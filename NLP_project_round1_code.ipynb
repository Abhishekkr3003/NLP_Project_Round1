      "Down the Rabbit-Hole\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\n",
      "bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\n",
      "the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\n",
      "conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\n",
      "“without pictures or conversations?”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\n",
      "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\n",
      "so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\n",
      "dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\n",
      "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\n",
      "time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\n",
      "watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\n",
      "on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\n",
      "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\n",
      "watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n",
      "field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\n",
      "large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\n",
      "deep well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\n",
      "was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\n",
      "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\n",
      "passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\n",
      "cupboards as she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\n",
      "at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\n",
      "top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\n",
      "many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\n",
      "getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\n",
      "be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\n",
      "several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\n",
      "though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\n",
      "knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\n",
      "practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\n",
      "then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\n",
      "idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\n",
      "grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\n",
      "the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\n",
      "with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\n",
      "glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\n",
      "the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\n",
      "country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\n",
      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\n",
      "falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\n",
      "an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\n",
      "to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n",
      "talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\n",
      "(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\n",
      "tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\n",
      "no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\n",
      "very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\n",
      "Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\n",
      "dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\n",
      "sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\n",
      "either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\n",
      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\n",
      "walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n",
      "“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\n",
      "thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\n",
      "the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\n",
      "she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\n",
      "long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\n",
      "it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\n",
      "and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\n",
      "and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n",
      "from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",
      "Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n",
      "door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\n",
      "get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\n",
      "passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\n",
      "out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\n",
      "flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\n",
      "through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\n",
      "poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\n",
      "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\n",
      "knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\n",
      "happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\n",
      "indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\n",
      "before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",
      "label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\n",
      "letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\n",
      "not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\n",
      "“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\n",
      "several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\n",
      "eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n",
      "_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\n",
      "such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\n",
      "and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\n",
      "bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\n",
      "bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\n",
      "sooner or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\n",
      "taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\n",
      "flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\n",
      "hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n",

      "“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\n",
      "telescope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\n",
      "brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\n",
      "through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\n",
      "waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\n",
      "she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\n",
      "said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\n",
      "wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\n",
      "flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\n",
      "not remember ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\n",
      "into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\n",
      "door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n",
      "went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n",
      "it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\n",
      "best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\n",
      "sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\n",
      "rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\n",
      "gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\n",
      "and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\n",
      "her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\n",
      "cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\n",
      "for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n",
      "“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\n",
      "people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\n",
      "person!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\n",
      "she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n",
      "“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\n",
      "Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\n",
      "makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\n",
      "get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\n",
      "way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\n",
      "growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\n",
      "size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\n",
      "had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\n",
      "things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\n",
      "on in the common way.\n",

      "no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\n",
      "made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\n",

      "\n",
      "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\n",
      "that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\n",
      "she was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\n",
      "growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\n",
      "herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\n",
      "now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\n",

      "sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\n",
      "now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\n",
      "door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\n",
      "key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\n",
      "ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\n",
      "before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\n",
      "splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\n",
      "she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\n",
      "railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\n",
      "her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\n",
      "to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\n",
      "sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\n",
      "of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\n",
      "soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\n",
      "she was nine feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\n",
      "to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\n",
      "being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\n",
      "sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n",
      "off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\n",
      "it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\n",
      "she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n",
      "slipped in like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\n",
      "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\n",
      "likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\n",
      "began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\n",
      "of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\n",
      "way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\n",
      "she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\n",
      "a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\n",
      "but it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\n",
      "a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\n",
      "her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\n",
      "anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\n",
      "was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\n",
      "sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\n",
      "fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\n",
      "had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\n",
      "cats.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\n",
      "_you_ like cats if you were me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\n",
      "about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\n",
      "take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\n",
      "quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\n",
      "in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\n",
      "paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\n",
      "nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\n",
      "pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\n",
      "over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\n",
      "about her any more if you’d rather not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\n",
      "tail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n",
      "_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\n",
      "again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n",
      "conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\n",
      "answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\n",
      "our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\n",
      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\n",
      "you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\n",
      "of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\n",
      "know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\n",
      "it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n",
      "“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\n",
      "from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\n",
      "pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",
      "won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\n",
      "Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\n",
      "was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\n",
      "trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\n",
      "history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n",
      "birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\n",
      "Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\n",
      "led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\n",
      "birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\n",
      "to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\n",
      "consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\n",
      "natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\n",
      "she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\n",
      "with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\n",
      "older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\n",
      "without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\n",
      "tell its age, there was no more to be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\n",
      "called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\n",
      "you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\n",
      "Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\n",
      "felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\n",
      "is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\n",
      "the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\n",
      "to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\n",
      "accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\n",
      "Mercia and Northumbria—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\n",
      "you speak?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\n",
      "the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\n",
      "Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\n",
      "\n",

      "what ‘it’ means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\n",
      "Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\n",
      "archbishop find?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\n",
      "it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\n",
      "the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\n",
      "of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\n",
      "turning to Alice as it spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\n",
      "dry me at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\n",
      "that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\n",
      "remedies—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\n",
      "those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\n",
      "the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\n",
      "tittered audibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\n",
      "that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\n",
      "know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\n",
      "speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\n",
      "as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\n",
      "tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\n",
      "shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\n",
      "along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\n",
      "away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\n",
      "liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\n",
      "when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\n",
      "again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\n",
      "crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\n",
      "thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\n",
      "forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\n",
      "pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\n",
      "said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\n",
      "finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\n",
      "confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\n",
      "pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\n",
      "not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\n",
      "one a-piece, all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\n",
      "your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\n",
      "presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\n",
      "thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\n",
      "cheered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\n",
      "that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\n",
      "to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\n",
      "she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\n",
      "begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\n",
      "it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\n",
      "would be offended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\n",
      "sighing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\n",
      "at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\n",
      "puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\n",
      "tale was something like this:—\n",
      "\n",
      "         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\n",
      "         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\n",
      "         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\n",
      "         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\n",
      "         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\n",
      "         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\n",
      "         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\n",
      "you thinking of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\n",
      "bend, I think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\n",
      "anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\n",
      "walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\n",
      "you know!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mouse only growled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\n",
      "the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\n",
      "shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\n",
      "quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\n",
      "her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\n",
      "_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\n",
      "snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\n",
      "addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\n",
      "Lory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n",
      "“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\n",
      "can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\n",
      "she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\n",

      "carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\n",
      "doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\n",
      "to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\n",
      "bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\n",
      "alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\n",
      "tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\n",
      "cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\n",
      "any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\n",
      "lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\n",
      "little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\n",

      "\n",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\n",
      "called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\n",
      "doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\n",
      "a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\n",
      "at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\n",
      "mistake it had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\n",
      "surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\n",
      "his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",
      "real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\n",
      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\n",
      "don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\n",
      "if it began ordering people about like that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\n",
      "pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\n",
      "gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\n",
      "little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\n",
      "this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\n",
      "and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\n",
      "happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\n",
      "I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\n",
      "again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",
      "and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\n",
      "down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\n",
      "grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\n",
      "drunk quite so much!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\n",
      "yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\n",
      "that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\n",
      "one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\n",
      "when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\n",
      "now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\n",
      "then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\n",
      "lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\n",
      "for any lesson-books!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\n",
      "making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\n",
      "she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\n",
      "large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\n",
      "help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\n",
      "of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\n",
      "they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n",
      "_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\n",
      "talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\n",
      "ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\n",
      "together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\n",
      "well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\n",
      "rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\n",
      "Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\n",
      "fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\n",
      "it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\n",
      "you’re to go down the chimney!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\n",
      "herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\n",
      "Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "I _think_ I can kick a little!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\n",
      "she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\n",
      "to see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\n",
      "then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\n",
      "now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\n",
      "us all about it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\n",
      "Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\n",
      "called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\n",
      "wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\n",
      "roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\n",
      "this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\n",
      "again!” which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\n",
      "_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\n",
      "must make me smaller, I suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\n",
      "through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\n",
      "little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\n",
      "was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\n",
      "second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\n",
      "will be the best plan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\n",
      "thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\n",
      "it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\n",
      "might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\n",
      "spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\n",
      "and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\n",
      "I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\n",
      "suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\n",
      "question is, what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\n",
      "caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\n",
      "smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\n",
      "anything else.\n",

      "CHAPTER V.\n",
      "Advice from a Caterpillar\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\n",
      "silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\n",
      "addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\n",
      "who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\n",
      "changed several times since then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\n",
      "yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\n",
      "not myself, you see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\n",
      "“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, won’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\n",
      "is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\n",
      "think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\n",
      "important to say!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\n",
      "and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\n",
      "some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\n",
      "its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\n",
      "think you’re changed, do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\n",
      "used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\n",
      "came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice folded her hands, and began:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\n",
      "    “And your hair has become very white;\n",
      "And yet you incessantly stand on your head—\n",
      "    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\n",
      "    “I feared it might injure the brain;\n",
      "But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\n",
      "    Why, I do it again and again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\n",
      "    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\n",
      "Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\n",
      "    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n",
      "    “I kept all my limbs very supple\n",
      "By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\n",
      "    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\n",
      "    For anything tougher than suet;\n",
      "Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\n",
      "    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\n",
      "    And argued each case with my wife;\n",
      "And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n",
      "    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",

      "grow shorter.”\n",

      "trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\n",

      "last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\n",
      "off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\n",
      "violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",

      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\n",
      "sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n",
      "\n",

      "She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\n",

      "\n",
      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\n",
      "she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\n",
      "her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\n",
      "had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\n",
      "going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\n",
      "the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\n",
      "hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\n",
      "face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\n",

      "\n",
      "“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",

      "hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\n",
      "serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\n",
      "saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\n",

      "haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\n",
      "see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\n",
      "Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\n",
      "should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\n",
      "from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\n",
      "invent something!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\n",
      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n",
      "_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\n",
      "no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\n",
      "tasted an egg!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\n",
      "child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\n",
      "they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\n",
      "looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\n",
      "me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\n",
      "looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\n",
      "_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\n",
      "as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\n",
      "and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\n",
      "she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\n",
      "and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\n",
      "the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\n",
      "she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\n",
      "done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\n",
      "going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\n",
      "right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\n",
      "_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\n",
      "upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n",
      "“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\n",
      "_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\n",
      "began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\n",
      "near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n",

      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\n",
      "wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",
      "fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\n",
      "another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\n",
      "all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\n",
      "about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\n",
      "Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\n",
      "tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\n",
      "An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\n",
      "for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\n",
      "noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\n",
      "and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\n",
      "if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\n",
      "know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\n",
      "this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\n",
      "she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\n",
      "head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\n",
      "she repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\n",
      "question, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\n",
      "dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\n",
      "It’s enough to drive one crazy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",
      "remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\n",
      "days and days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\n",
      "in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\n",
      "stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\n",
      "herself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\n",
      "occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\n",
      "on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\n",
      "your cat grins like that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\n",
      "baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\n",
      "know that cats _could_ grin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\n",
      "pleased to have got into a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\n",
      "in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\n",
      "unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\n",
      "get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\n",
      "think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\n",
      "earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",
      "be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\n",
      "is it twelve? I—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\n",
      "figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\n",
      "sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\n",
      "the end of every line:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak roughly to your little boy,\n",
      "    And beat him when he sneezes:\n",
      "He only does it to annoy,\n",
      "    Because he knows it teases.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHORUS.\n",
      "(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wow! wow! wow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\n",
      "the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\n",
      "that Alice could hardly hear the words:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I speak severely to my boy,\n",
      "    I beat him when he sneezes;\n",
      "For he can thoroughly enjoy\n",

      "flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\n",
      "croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\n",
      "threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\n",
      "little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n",
      "“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\n",
      "snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\n",
      "itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\n",
      "the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\n",
      "twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\n",
      "ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\n",
      "out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\n",
      "thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\n",
      "murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\n",
      "little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n",
      "“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\n",
      "expressing yourself.”\n",

      "to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\n",
      "a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\n",
      "its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\n",
      "not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\n",
      "sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\n",
      "were any tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\n",
      "said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\n",
      "now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\n",
      "with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\n",
      "violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\n",
      "there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\n",
      "a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\n",
      "further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\n",
      "trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\n",
      "herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\n",
      "rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\n",
      "was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\n",
      "a tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\n",
      "thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\n",
      "felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\n",
      "whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\n",
      "wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\n",
      "“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\n",
      "enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\n",
      "question. “What sort of people live about here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\n",
      "a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\n",
      "March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\n",
      "You’re mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\n",
      "do you know that you’re mad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose so,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\n",
      "and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\n",
      "and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\n",
      "Queen to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\n",
      "yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\n",
      "things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\n",
      "it suddenly appeared again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\n",
      "forgotten to ask.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\n",
      "in a natural way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\n",
      "appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\n",
      "which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\n",
      "said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\n",
      "perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\n",
      "was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\n",
      "again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\n",
      "and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\n",
      "beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\n",
      "remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\n",
      "grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\n",
      "the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\n",
      "chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\n",
      "was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\n",
      "nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\n",
      "to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\n",
      "timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\n",
      "I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\n",

      "CHAPTER VII.\n",
      "A Mad Tea-Party\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\n",
      "March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\n",
      "between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\n",
      "cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\n",
      "uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\n",
      "I suppose it doesn’t mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\n",
      "one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\n",
      "Alice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\n",
      "she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n",
      "“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\n",
      "many more than three.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\n",
      "Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\n",
      "speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\n",
      "severity; “it’s very rude.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\n",
      "was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\n",
      "begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly so,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\n",
      "say—that’s the same thing, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\n",
      "say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\n",
      "I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\n",
      "talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\n",
      "as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\n",
      "Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\n",
      "writing-desks, which wasn’t much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\n",
      "is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\n",
      "pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\n",
      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\n",
      "the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\n",
      "“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",
      "nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\n",
      "you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\n",
      "funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\n",
      "tell what o’clock it is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\n",
      "year it is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\n",
      "stays the same year for such a long time together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\n",
      "sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\n",
      "understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\n",
      "hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\n",
      "eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\n",
      "time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\n",
      "answers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\n",
      "about wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\n",
      "contemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\n",
      "time when I learn music.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\n",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\n",
      "hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\n",
      "time for dinner!”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\n",
      "shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\n",
      "half-past one as long as you liked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\n",
      "quarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\n",
      "with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\n",
      "given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n",
      "How I wonder what you’re at!’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the song, perhaps?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",
      "                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n",
      "“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\n",
      "had to pinch it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\n",
      "Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\n",
      "head!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\n",
      "do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\n",
      "tea-things are put out here?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\n",
      "and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\n",
      "to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n",
      "“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\n",
      "proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\n",
      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\n",
      "hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\n",
      "before it’s done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\n",
      "in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\n",
      "they lived at the bottom of a well—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\n",
      "in questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\n",
      "two.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\n",
      "“they’d have been ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\n",
      "living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\n",
      "why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\n",
      "take more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\n",
      "take _more_ than nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\n",
      "some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\n",
      "repeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\n",
      "said, “It was a treacle-well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\n",
      "Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\n",
      "remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\n",
      "dare say there may be _one_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\n",
      "go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\n",
      "you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\n",
      "moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\n",
      "place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\n",
      "advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\n",
      "before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\n",
      "cautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\n",
      "from?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\n",
      "think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\n",
      "to notice this last remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\n",
      "some time without interrupting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\n",
      "its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\n",
      "things—everything that begins with an M—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why with an M?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\n",
      "doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\n",
      "little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\n",
      "mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\n",
      "things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\n",
      "drawing of a muchness?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\n",
      "think—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\n",
      "great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\n",
      "neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\n",
      "looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\n",

      "\n",
      "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\n",

      "led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n",
      "(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\n",
      "high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\n",

      "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\n",
      "things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\n",

      "_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\n",
      "was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\n",
      "you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\n",
      "moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\n",
      "out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\n",
      "themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\n",
      "and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\n",
      "three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\n",
      "corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\n",
      "diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\n",
      "the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\n",
      "jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\n",
      "ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\n",
      "and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\n",
      "hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\n",
      "by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\n",
      "the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\n",
      "grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\n",
      "like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\n",
      "of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\n",
      "procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\n",
      "faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\n",
      "and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\n",
      "at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\n",
      "Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\n",
      "Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\n",
      "but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\n",
      "all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\n",
      "who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\n",
      "their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\n",
      "the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\n",
      "or courtiers, or three of her own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\n",
      "no business of _mine_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\n",
      "moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\n",
      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\n",
      "dear: she is only a child!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\n",
      "them over!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\n",

      "the royal children, and everybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\n",
      "turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\n",
      "here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\n",
      "down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n",
      "“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\n",
      "soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\n",
      "to Alice for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\n",
      "flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\n",
      "minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\n",
      "in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\n",
      "evidently meant for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!” shouted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\n",
      "wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\n",
      "walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\n",
      "anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\n",
      "tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\n",
      "sentence of execution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\n",
      "‘What for?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\n",
      "scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\n",
      "tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\n",
      "Queen said—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\n",
      "in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\n",
      "hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\n",
      "themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\n",
      "under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\n",
      "had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\n",
      "hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\n",
      "up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\n",
      "bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\n",
      "going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\n",
      "had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\n",
      "this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\n",
      "always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\n",
      "soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\n",
      "the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\n",
      "shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\n",
      "dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n",
      "“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\n",
      "one left alive!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\n",
      "appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\n",
      "watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\n",
      "to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\n",
      "to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\n",
      "speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\n",
      "of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\n",
      "was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\n",
      "complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\n",
      "oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\n",
      "least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\n",
      "arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\n",
      "ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\n",
      "it ran away when it saw mine coming!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\n",
      "that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",
      "“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\n",
      "looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\n",
      "introduce it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\n",
      "kiss my hand if it likes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\n",
      "that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\n",
      "but I don’t remember where.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\n",
      "the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\n",
      "have this cat removed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\n",
      "small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\n",
      "hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\n",
      "on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\n",
      "passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\n",
      "of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\n",
      "whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\n",
      "to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\n",
      "other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\n",
      "the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\n",
      "helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\n",
      "was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\n",
      "matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\n",
      "of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\n",
      "escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\n",
      "a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\n",
      "the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\n",
      "while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\n",
      "the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\n",
      "all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\n",
      "what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\n",
      "there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\n",
      "thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\n",
      "less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\n",

      "anxious.)\n",

      "“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\n",
      "And the executioner went off like an arrow.\n",

      "“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\n",
      "tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\n",
      "does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\n",
      "hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\n",
      "kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\n",
      "them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\n",
      "sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\n",
      "so stingy about it, you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\n",
      "startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\n",
      "about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\n",
      "tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\n",
      "a bit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\n",
      "you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\n",
      "she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\n",
      "Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\n",
      "right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\n",
      "uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\n",
      "bore it as well as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\n",
      "the conversation a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\n",
      "’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\n",
      "their own business!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\n",
      "sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\n",
      "_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\n",
      "themselves.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\n",
      "the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\n",
      "the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\n",
      "to have the experiment tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\n",
      "the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\n",
      "putting things!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\n",
      "everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\n",
      "And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\n",
      "of yours.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\n",
      "remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\n",
      "is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\n",
      "simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\n",
      "appear to others that what you were or might have been was not\n",
      "otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\n",
      "otherwise.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\n",
      "“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\n",
      "in a pleased tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\n",
      "Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present\n",
      "of everything I’ve said as yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\n",
      "birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\n",
      "loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\n",
      "little chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\n",
      "feel a little worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\n",
      "the m—”\n",
      "\n",
      "But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\n",
      "even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\n",
      "linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\n",
      "Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\n",
      "thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\n",
      "ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\n",
      "about half no time! Take your choice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\n",
      "much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\n",
      "croquet-ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\n",
      "resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\n",
      "back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\n",
      "would cost them their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\n",
      "with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\n",
      "her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\n",
      "soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\n",
      "that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\n",
      "all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\n",
      "and under sentence of execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\n",
      "you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\n",
      "to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\n",
      "good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\n",
      "number of executions the Queen had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\n",
      "you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\n",
      "thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\n",
      "executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\n",
      "with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\n",
      "but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\n",
      "as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\n",
      "she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,\n",
      "half to itself, half to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\n",
      "executes nobody, you know. Come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\n",
      "after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\n",
      "sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\n",
      "nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\n",
      "pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\n",
      "Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\n",
      "his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\n",
      "history, she do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\n",
      "down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\n",
      "But she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\n",
      "Turtle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\n",
      "heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\n",
      "saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\n",
      "help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\n",
      "sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\n",
      "angrily: “really you are very dull!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\n",
      "question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\n",
      "at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\n",
      "Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\n",
      "day about it!” and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\n",
      "The Mock Turtle went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\n",
      "proud as all that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\n",
      "tone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n",
      "‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\n",
      "of the sea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\n",
      "only took the regular course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that?” inquired Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\n",
      "replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\n",
      "Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of\n",
      "uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\n",
      "is, you _are_ a simpleton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\n",
      "she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\n",
      "subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\n",
      "Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\n",
      "that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\n",
      "Fainting in Coils.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\n",
      "stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\n",
      "though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\n",
      "Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\n",
      "creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\n",
      "to change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\n",
      "“because they lessen from day to day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\n",
      "before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\n",
      "a holiday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\n",
      "decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\n",

      "CHAPTER X.\n",
      "The Lobster Quadrille\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\n",
      "his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\n",
      "two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\n",
      "said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\n",
      "the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\n",
      "running down his cheeks, he went on again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\n",
      "Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\n",
      "(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\n",
      "said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\n",
      "Lobster Quadrille is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\n",
      "sea-shore—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\n",
      "then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—you advance twice—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—as far out to sea as you can—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\n",
      "been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\n",
      "sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\n",
      "Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\n",
      "then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\n",
      "forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\n",
      "and sadly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\n",
      "“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\n",
      "See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\n",
      "They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\n",
      "When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\n",
      "But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\n",
      "Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\n",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\n",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\n",
      "“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\n",
      "The further off from England the nearer is to France—\n",
      "Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\n",
      "feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\n",
      "curious song about the whiting!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\n",
      "of course?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\n",
      "hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\n",
      "seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\n",
      "their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\n",
      "all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\n",
      "and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\n",
      "eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\n",
      "lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\n",
      "fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\n",
      "couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\n",
      "about a whiting before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\n",
      "know why it’s called a whiting?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\n",
      "in a wondering tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\n",
      "makes them so shiny?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\n",
      "answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n",
      "“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n",
      "“any shrimp could have told you that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\n",
      "running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\n",
      "please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\n",
      "wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\n",
      "and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\n",
      "the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\n",
      "Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\n",
      "because I was a different person then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n",
      "“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\n",
      "saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\n",
      "the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\n",
      "their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\n",
      "went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\n",
      "about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\n",
      "Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\n",
      "Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\n",
      "should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\n",

      "thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\n",
      "up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\n",

      "very queer indeed:—\n",

      "“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\n",
      "puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\n",

      "\n",
      "Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\n",
      "wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—\n",

      "\n",

      "Who Stole the Tarts?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\n",
      "arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\n",
      "birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\n",
      "standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\n",
      "him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\n",
      "hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\n",
      "court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\n",
      "good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\n",
      "get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\n",
      "But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\n",
      "everything about her, to pass away the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\n",
      "about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n",
      "the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to\n",
      "herself, “because of his great wig.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\n",
      "wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\n",
      "did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\n",
      "(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\n",
      "animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\n",
      "said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\n",
      "proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\n",
      "girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\n",
      "would have done just as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\n",
      "they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything\n",
      "to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n",
      "“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\n",
      "stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\n",
      "court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\n",
      "to make out who was talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\n",
      "that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\n",
      "and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\n",
      "“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\n",
      "muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\n",
      "could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\n",
      "very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\n",
      "that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\n",
      "at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\n",
      "was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\n",
      "was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\n",
      "unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n",
      "    All on a summer day:\n",
      "The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n",
      "    And took them quite away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great\n",
      "deal to come before that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\n",
      "three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\n",
      "and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your\n",
      "Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\n",
      "my tea when I was sent for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\n",
      "court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\n",
      "was,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\n",
      "wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\n",
      "reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\n",
      "a memorandum of the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none\n",
      "of my own. I’m a hatter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\n",
      "who turned pale and fidgeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\n",
      "have you executed on the spot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\n",
      "from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\n",
      "confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\n",
      "bread-and-butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\n",
      "her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\n",
      "grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\n",
      "the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\n",
      "as long as there was room for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\n",
      "next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\n",
      "too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\n",
      "that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\n",
      "to the other side of the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",
      "of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\n",
      "on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\n",
      "executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n",
      "“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\n",
      "bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you\n",
      "take me for a dunce? Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\n",
      "that—only the March Hare said—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did!” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\n",
      "anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\n",
      "nothing, being fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\n",
      "down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\n",
      "the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\n",
      "explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\n",
      "up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\n",
      "head first, and then sat upon it.)\n",

      "“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in\n",
      "the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\n",
      "applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\n",
      "court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\n",

      "the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\n",
      "without even waiting to put his shoes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\n",
      "officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\n",
      "to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call the next witness!” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\n",
      "her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\n",
      "court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give your evidence,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shan’t,” said the cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n",
      "“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\n",

      "“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\n",
      "after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\n",
      "nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\n",

      "disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\n",

      "forehead ache!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\n",
      "very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\n",

      "\n",
      "“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\n",
      "large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\n",
      "a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\n",
      "upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\n",
      "they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\n",
      "goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\n",
      "began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\n",
      "of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\n",
      "idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\n",
      "jury-box, or they would die.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\n",
      "all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\n",
      "with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\n",
      "the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\n",
      "tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\n",
      "got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\n",
      "said to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\n",
      "trial one way up as the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\n",
      "upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\n",
      "them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\n",
      "accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\n",
      "anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\n",
      "court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\n",
      "just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\n",
      "Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\n",
      "said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\n",
      "he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\n",
      "to himself in an undertone,\n",
      "\n",
      "“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\n",
      "which word sounded best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\n",
      "Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n",
      "“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\n",
      "his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\n",
      "Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\n",
      "regular rule: you invented it just now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your\n",
      "verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\n",
      "White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been\n",
      "picked up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s in it?” said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\n",
      "letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\n",
      "nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\n",
      "nothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\n",
      "and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\n",
      "thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\n",
      "all brightened up again.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\n",
      "can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\n",
      "worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\n",
      "your name like an honest man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\n",
      "clever thing the King had said that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know\n",
      "what they’re about!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Read them,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please\n",
      "your Majesty?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you\n",
      "come to the end: then stop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“They told me you had been to her,\n",
      "    And mentioned me to him:\n",
      "She gave me a good character,\n",
      "    But said I could not swim.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sent them word I had not gone\n",
      "    (We know it to be true):\n",
      "If she should push the matter on,\n",
      "    What would become of you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave her one, they gave him two,\n",
      "    You gave us three or more;\n",
      "They all returned from him to you,\n",
      "    Though they were mine before.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I or she should chance to be\n",
      "    Involved in this affair,\n",
      "He trusts to you to set them free,\n",
      "    Exactly as we were.\n",
      "\n",
      "My notion was that you had been\n",
      "    (Before she had this fit)\n",
      "An obstacle that came between\n",
      "    Him, and ourselves, and it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t let him know she liked them best,\n",
      "    For this must ever be\n",
      "A secret, kept from all the rest,\n",
      "    Between yourself and me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\n",
      "King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\n",
      "large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\n",
      "interrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s\n",
      "an atom of meaning in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\n",
      "an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\n",
      "paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\n",
      "trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\n",
      "know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\n",
      "them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n",
      "“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\n",
      "to the Knave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\n",
      "certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\n",
      "verses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\n",
      "course—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\n",
      "did with the tarts, you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\n",
      "tarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\n",
      "again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\n",
      "think?” he said to the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\n",
      "as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\n",
      "slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\n",
      "began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\n",
      "as it lasted.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\n",
      "court with a smile. There was a dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\n",
      "laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\n",
      "about the twentieth time that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\n",
      "sentence first!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t!” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\n",
      "moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\n",
      "this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\n",
      "her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\n",
      "tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\n",
      "head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\n",
      "leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\n",
      "had!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\n",
      "sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\n",
      "Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\n",
      "had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\n",
      "dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\n",
      "So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\n",
      "what a wonderful dream it had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\n",
      "hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\n",
      "her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\n",
      "and this was her dream:—\n",
      "\n",
      "First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\n",
      "hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\n",
      "looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\n",
      "see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\n",
      "that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\n",
      "seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\n",
      "strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\n",
      "frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\n",
      "could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\n",
      "shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\n",
      "ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\n",
      "was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\n",
      "around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\n",
      "Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\n",
      "filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\n",
      "Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\n",
      "Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\n",
      "would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\n",
      "wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\n",
      "teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\n",
      "cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\n",
      "shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n",
      "(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\n",
      "lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\n",
      "Turtle’s heavy sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\n",
      "would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\n",
      "keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\n",
      "childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\n",
      "and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\n",
      "perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\n",
      "would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\n",
      "their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\n",
      "days.\n",

      "Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my\n",
      "own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about\n",
      "a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to\n",
      "regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery\n",
      "in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors\n",
      "is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\n",
      "shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You\n",
      "will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that\n",
      "Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.\n",
      "How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were\n",
      "partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\n",
      "was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\n",
      "assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\n",
      "sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully\n",
      "cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\n",
      "man of business on the very day of the funeral,\n",
      "and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to\n",
      "the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley\n",
      "was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or\n",
      "nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going\n",
      "to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that\n",
      "Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there\n",
      "would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\n",
      "stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\n",
      "than there would be in any other middle-aged\n",
      "gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\n",
      "spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--\n",
      "literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\n",
      "There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\n",
      "door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as\n",
      "Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the\n",
      "business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,\n",
      "but he answered to both names. It was all the\n",
      "same to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\n",
      "Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\n",
      "clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,\n",
      "from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\n",
      "secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The\n",
      "cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\n",
      "nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\n",
      "eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\n",
      "grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his\n",
      "eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low\n",
      "temperature always about with him; he iced his office in\n",
      "the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "External heat and cold had little influence on\n",
      "Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather\n",
      "chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,\n",
      "no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\n",
      "pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't\n",
      "know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and\n",
      "snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\n",
      "over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"\n",
      "handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\n",
      "gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\n",
      "When will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored\n",
      "him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\n",
      "what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\n",
      "his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\n",
      "Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\n",
      "know him; and when they saw him coming on, would\n",
      "tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\n",
      "then would wag their tails as though they said, \"No\n",
      "eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing\n",
      "he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths\n",
      "of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\n",
      "was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\n",
      "on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his\n",
      "counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\n",
      "withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\n",
      "go wheezing up and down, beating their hands\n",
      "upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\n",
      "pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had\n",
      "only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\n",
      "it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\n",
      "in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\n",
      "ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog\n",
      "came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\n",
      "so dense without, that although the court was of the\n",
      "narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\n",
      "To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\n",
      "everything, one might have thought that Nature\n",
      "lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open\n",
      "that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\n",
      "dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\n",
      "letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\n",
      "fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\n",
      "coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept\n",
      "the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\n",
      "clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\n",
      "that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore\n",
      "the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to\n",
      "warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being\n",
      "a man of a strong imagination, he failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried\n",
      "a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was\n",
      "the first intimation he had of his approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the\n",
      "fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was\n",
      "all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his\n",
      "eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew. \"You don't mean that, I am sure?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What\n",
      "right have you to be merry? What reason have you\n",
      "to be merry? You're poor enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What\n",
      "right have you to be dismal? What reason have you\n",
      "to be morose? You're rich enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur\n",
      "of the moment, said, \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up\n",
      "with \"Humbug.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I\n",
      "live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!\n",
      "Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas\n",
      "time to you but a time for paying bills without\n",
      "money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but\n",
      "not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books\n",
      "and having every item in 'em through a round dozen\n",
      "of months presented dead against you? If I could\n",
      "work my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot\n",
      "who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,\n",
      "should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried\n",
      "with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas\n",
      "in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew. \"But you\n",
      "don't keep it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much\n",
      "good may it do you! Much good it has ever done\n",
      "you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are many things from which I might have\n",
      "derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare\n",
      "say,\" returned the nephew. \"Christmas among the\n",
      "rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas\n",
      "time, when it has come round--apart from the\n",
      "veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything\n",
      "belonging to it can be apart from that--as a\n",
      "good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant\n",
      "time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar\n",
      "of the year, when men and women seem by one consent\n",
      "to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think\n",
      "of people below them as if they really were\n",
      "fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race\n",
      "of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\n",
      "uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or\n",
      "silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me\n",
      "good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.\n",
      "Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,\n",
      "he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark\n",
      "for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me hear another sound from you,\" said\n",
      "Scrooge, \"and you'll keep your Christmas by losing\n",
      "your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker,\n",
      "sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you\n",
      "don't go into Parliament.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he\n",
      "did. He went the whole length of the expression,\n",
      "and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I fell in love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if\n",
      "that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous\n",
      "than a merry Christmas. \"Good afternoon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before\n",
      "that happened. Why give it as a reason for not\n",
      "coming now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;\n",
      "why cannot we be friends?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so\n",
      "resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I\n",
      "have been a party. But I have made the trial in\n",
      "homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas\n",
      "humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And A Happy New Year!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "His nephew left the room without an angry word,\n",
      "notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to\n",
      "bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,\n",
      "cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\n",
      "them cordially.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who\n",
      "overheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a\n",
      "week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry\n",
      "Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had\n",
      "let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,\n",
      "pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,\n",
      "in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in\n",
      "their hands, and bowed to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the\n",
      "gentlemen, referring to his list. \"Have I the pleasure\n",
      "of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\"\n",
      "Scrooge replied. \"He died seven years ago, this very\n",
      "night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented\n",
      "by his surviving partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting\n",
      "his credentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "It certainly was; for they had been two kindred\n",
      "spirits. At the ominous word \"liberality,\" Scrooge\n",
      "frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\"\n",
      "said the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than\n",
      "usually desirable that we should make some slight\n",
      "provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer\n",
      "greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in\n",
      "want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands\n",
      "are in want of common comforts, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down\n",
      "the pen again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge.\n",
      "\"Are they still in operation?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish\n",
      "I could say they were not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,\n",
      "then?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Both very busy, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,\n",
      "that something had occurred to stop them in their\n",
      "useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I'm very glad to\n",
      "hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish\n",
      "Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,\"\n",
      "returned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring\n",
      "to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,\n",
      "and means of warmth. We choose this time, because\n",
      "it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,\n",
      "and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down\n",
      "for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You wish to be anonymous?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you\n",
      "ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.\n",
      "I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't\n",
      "afford to make idle people merry. I help to support\n",
      "the establishments I have mentioned--they cost\n",
      "enough; and those who are badly off must go there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had\n",
      "better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\n",
      "Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It's\n",
      "enough for a man to understand his own business, and\n",
      "not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies\n",
      "me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue\n",
      "their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed\n",
      "his labours with an improved opinion of himself,\n",
      "and in a more facetious temper than was usual\n",
      "with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that\n",
      "people ran about with flaring links, proffering their\n",
      "services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct\n",
      "them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\n",
      "whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down\n",
      "at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became\n",
      "invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the\n",
      "clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if\n",
      "its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\n",
      "The cold became intense. In the main street, at the\n",
      "corner of the court, some labourers were repairing\n",
      "the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\n",
      "round which a party of ragged men and boys were\n",
      "gathered: warming their hands and winking their\n",
      "eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\n",
      "being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,\n",
      "and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness\n",
      "of the shops where holly sprigs and berries\n",
      "crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale\n",
      "faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'\n",
      "trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,\n",
      "with which it was next to impossible to believe that\n",
      "such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything\n",
      "to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the\n",
      "mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks\n",
      "and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's\n",
      "household should; and even the little tailor, whom he\n",
      "had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for\n",
      "being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up\n",
      "to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean\n",
      "wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting\n",
      "cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped\n",
      "the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather\n",
      "as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then\n",
      "indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The\n",
      "owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled\n",
      "by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\n",
      "stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with\n",
      "a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"God bless you, merry gentleman!\n",
      "         May nothing you dismay!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,\n",
      "that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to\n",
      "the fog and even more congenial frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house\n",
      "arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his\n",
      "stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant\n",
      "clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,\n",
      "and put on his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said\n",
      "Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If quite convenient, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not\n",
      "fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd\n",
      "think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk smiled faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think me ill-used,\n",
      "when I pay a day's wages for no work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every\n",
      "twenty-fifth of December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning\n",
      "his great-coat to the chin. \"But I suppose you must\n",
      "have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\n",
      "morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge\n",
      "walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a\n",
      "twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his\n",
      "white comforter dangling below his waist (for he\n",
      "boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,\n",
      "at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in\n",
      "honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home\n",
      "to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play\n",
      "at blindman's-buff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual\n",
      "melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and\n",
      "beguiled the rest of the evening with his\n",
      "banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in\n",
      "chambers which had once belonged to his deceased\n",
      "partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a\n",
      "lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so\n",
      "little business to be, that one could scarcely help\n",
      "fancying it must have run there when it was a young\n",
      "house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,\n",
      "and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough\n",
      "now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but\n",
      "Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\n",
      "The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew\n",
      "its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.\n",
      "The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway\n",
      "of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of\n",
      "the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\n",
      "threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all\n",
      "particular about the knocker on the door, except that it\n",
      "was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had\n",
      "seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\n",
      "in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what\n",
      "is called fancy about him as any man in the city of\n",
      "London, even including--which is a bold word--the\n",
      "corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be\n",
      "borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one\n",
      "thought on Marley, since his last mention of his\n",
      "seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then\n",
      "let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened\n",
      "that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,\n",
      "saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate\n",
      "process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow\n",
      "as the other objects in the yard were, but had a\n",
      "dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark\n",
      "cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked\n",
      "at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly\n",
      "spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The\n",
      "hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\n",
      "and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly\n",
      "motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it\n",
      "horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the\n",
      "face and beyond its control, rather than a part of\n",
      "its own expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it\n",
      "was a knocker again.\n",
      "\n",
      "To say that he was not startled, or that his blood\n",
      "was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it\n",
      "had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.\n",
      "But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,\n",
      "turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before\n",
      "he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind\n",
      "it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the\n",
      "sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall.\n",
      "But there was nothing on the back of the door, except\n",
      "the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he\n",
      "said \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed it with a bang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound resounded through the house like thunder.\n",
      "Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's\n",
      "cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal\n",
      "of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to\n",
      "be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and\n",
      "walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:\n",
      "trimming his candle as he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six\n",
      "up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad\n",
      "young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you\n",
      "might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken\n",
      "it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall\n",
      "and the door towards the balustrades: and done it\n",
      "easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room\n",
      "to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge\n",
      "thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before\n",
      "him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of\n",
      "the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,\n",
      "so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with\n",
      "Scrooge's dip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.\n",
      "Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before\n",
      "he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms\n",
      "to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection\n",
      "of the face to desire to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they\n",
      "should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under\n",
      "the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin\n",
      "ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had\n",
      "a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the\n",
      "bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,\n",
      "which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\n",
      "against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,\n",
      "old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three\n",
      "legs, and a poker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked\n",
      "himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his\n",
      "custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off\n",
      "his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and\n",
      "his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take\n",
      "his gruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a\n",
      "bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and\n",
      "brood over it, before he could extract the least\n",
      "sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.\n",
      "The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch\n",
      "merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint\n",
      "Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\n",
      "There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;\n",
      "Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending\n",
      "through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,\n",
      "Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,\n",
      "hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;\n",
      "and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came\n",
      "like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the\n",
      "whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,\n",
      "with power to shape some picture on its surface from\n",
      "the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would\n",
      "have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Humbug!\" said Scrooge; and walked across the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several turns, he sat down again. As he\n",
      "threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened\n",
      "to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the\n",
      "room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten\n",
      "with a chamber in the highest story of the\n",
      "building. It was with great astonishment, and with\n",
      "a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he\n",
      "saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in\n",
      "the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it\n",
      "rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,\n",
      "but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had\n",
      "begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking\n",
      "noise, deep down below; as if some person were\n",
      "dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the\n",
      "wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have\n",
      "heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\n",
      "dragging chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,\n",
      "and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors\n",
      "below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight\n",
      "towards his door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won't believe it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His colour changed though, when, without a pause,\n",
      "it came on through the heavy door, and passed into\n",
      "the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the\n",
      "dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know\n",
      "him; Marley's Ghost!\" and fell again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,\n",
      "usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on\n",
      "the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,\n",
      "and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was\n",
      "clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound\n",
      "about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge\n",
      "observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,\n",
      "ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.\n",
      "His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,\n",
      "and looking through his waistcoat, could see\n",
      "the two buttons on his coat behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no\n",
      "bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he\n",
      "looked the phantom through and through, and saw\n",
      "it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\n",
      "influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very\n",
      "texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head\n",
      "and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;\n",
      "he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.\n",
      "\"What do you want with me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much!\"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ask me who I was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who were you then?\" said Scrooge, raising his\n",
      "voice. \"You're particular, for a shade.\" He was going\n",
      "to say \"to a shade,\" but substituted this, as more\n",
      "appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking\n",
      "doubtfully at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do it, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know\n",
      "whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in\n",
      "a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event\n",
      "of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity\n",
      "of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat\n",
      "down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he\n",
      "were quite used to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of\n",
      "your senses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you doubt your senses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them.\n",
      "A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may\n",
      "be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of\n",
      "cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of\n",
      "gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking\n",
      "jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means\n",
      "waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\n",
      "smart, as a means of distracting his own attention,\n",
      "and keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice\n",
      "disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence\n",
      "for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very\n",
      "deuce with him. There was something very awful,\n",
      "too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\n",
      "atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it\n",
      "himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the\n",
      "Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts,\n",
      "and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour\n",
      "from an oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning\n",
      "quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned;\n",
      "and wishing, though it were only for a second, to\n",
      "divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" replied the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" returned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow\n",
      "this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a\n",
      "legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug,\n",
      "I tell you! humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook\n",
      "its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that\n",
      "Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself\n",
      "from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was\n",
      "his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage\n",
      "round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,\n",
      "its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands\n",
      "before his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy!\" he said. \"Dreadful apparition, why do\n",
      "you trouble me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do\n",
      "you believe in me or not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits\n",
      "walk the earth, and why do they come to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned,\n",
      "\"that the spirit within him should walk abroad among\n",
      "his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that\n",
      "spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so\n",
      "after death. It is doomed to wander through the\n",
      "world--oh, woe is me!--and witness what it cannot\n",
      "share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to\n",
      "happiness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain\n",
      "and wrung its shadowy hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell\n",
      "me why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost.\n",
      "\"I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded\n",
      "it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I\n",
      "wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge trembled more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the\n",
      "weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?\n",
      "It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven\n",
      "Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since.\n",
      "It is a ponderous chain!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the\n",
      "expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty\n",
      "or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jacob,\" he said, imploringly. \"Old Jacob Marley,\n",
      "tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have none to give,\" the Ghost replied. \"It comes\n",
      "from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed\n",
      "by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor\n",
      "can I tell you what I would. A very little more is\n",
      "all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I\n",
      "cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked\n",
      "beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my\n",
      "spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our\n",
      "money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before\n",
      "me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became\n",
      "thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.\n",
      "Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now,\n",
      "but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his\n",
      "knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\"\n",
      "Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though\n",
      "with humility and deference.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Slow!\" the Ghost repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seven years dead,\" mused Scrooge. \"And travelling\n",
      "all the time!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The whole time,\" said the Ghost. \"No rest, no\n",
      "peace. Incessant torture of remorse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You travel fast?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the wings of the wind,\" replied the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You might have got over a great quantity of\n",
      "ground in seven years,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and\n",
      "clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of\n",
      "the night, that the Ward would have been justified in\n",
      "indicting it for a nuisance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,\" cried the\n",
      "phantom, \"not to know, that ages of incessant labour\n",
      "by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into\n",
      "eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\n",
      "all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit\n",
      "working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may\n",
      "be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast\n",
      "means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of\n",
      "regret can make amends for one life's opportunity\n",
      "misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you were always a good man of business,\n",
      "Jacob,\" faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this\n",
      "to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Business!\" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands\n",
      "again. \"Mankind was my business. The common\n",
      "welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,\n",
      "and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings\n",
      "of my trade were but a drop of water in the\n",
      "comprehensive ocean of my business!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were\n",
      "the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it\n",
      "heavily upon the ground again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this time of the rolling year,\" the spectre said,\n",
      "\"I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of\n",
      "fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never\n",
      "raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise\n",
      "Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to\n",
      "which its light would have conducted me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the\n",
      "spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake\n",
      "exceedingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hear me!\" cried the Ghost. \"My time is nearly\n",
      "gone.\"\n",

      "\"I will,\" said Scrooge. \"But don't be hard upon\n",

      "\n",
      "\"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that\n",
      "you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible\n",
      "beside you many and many a day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered,\n",
      "and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is no light part of my penance,\" pursued\n",
      "the Ghost. \"I am here to-night to warn you, that you\n",
      "have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A\n",
      "chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were always a good friend to me,\" said\n",
      "Scrooge. \"Thank'ee!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will be haunted,\" resumed the Ghost, \"by\n",
      "Three Spirits.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the\n",
      "Ghost's had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned,\n",
      "Jacob?\" he demanded, in a faltering voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--I think I'd rather not,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Without their visits,\" said the Ghost, \"you cannot\n",
      "hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow,\n",
      "when the bell tolls One.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over,\n",
      "Jacob?\" hinted Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Expect the second on the next night at the same\n",
      "hour. The third upon the next night when the last\n",
      "stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see\n",
      "me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you\n",
      "remember what has passed between us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When it had said these words, the spectre took its\n",
      "wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head,\n",
      "as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its\n",
      "teeth made, when the jaws were brought together\n",
      "by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again,\n",
      "and found his supernatural visitor confronting him\n",
      "in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and\n",
      "about its arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apparition walked backward from him; and at\n",
      "every step it took, the window raised itself a little,\n",
      "so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.\n",
      "When they were within two paces of each other,\n",
      "Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to\n",
      "come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:\n",
      "for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible\n",
      "of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of\n",
      "lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\n",
      "self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment,\n",
      "joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the\n",
      "bleak, dark night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his\n",
      "curiosity. He looked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither\n",
      "and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they\n",
      "went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's\n",
      "Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)\n",
      "were linked together; none were free. Many had\n",
      "been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He\n",
      "had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white\n",
      "waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to\n",
      "its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist\n",
      "a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,\n",
      "upon a door-step. The misery with them all was,\n",
      "clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in\n",
      "human matters, and had lost the power for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist\n",
      "enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and\n",
      "their spirit voices faded together; and the night became\n",
      "as it had been when he walked home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door\n",
      "by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked,\n",
      "as he had locked it with his own hands, and\n",
      "the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\"\n",
      "but stopped at the first syllable. And being,\n",
      "from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues\n",
      "of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or\n",
      "the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of\n",
      "the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to\n",
      "bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the\n",
      "instant.\n",

      "STAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,\n",
      "he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from\n",
      "the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to\n",
      "pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a\n",
      "neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened\n",
      "for the hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from\n",
      "six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to\n",
      "twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he\n",
      "went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have\n",
      "got into the works. Twelve!\n",
      "\n",
      "He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most\n",
      "preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:\n",
      "and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have\n",
      "slept through a whole day and far into another night. It\n",
      "isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and\n",
      "this is twelve at noon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,\n",
      "and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub\n",
      "the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he\n",
      "could see anything; and could see very little then. All he\n",
      "could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely\n",
      "cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,\n",
      "and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been\n",
      "if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the\n",
      "world.  This was a great relief, because \"three days after sight\n",
      "of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his\n",
      "order,\" and so forth, would have become a mere United States'\n",
      "security if there were no days to count by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought\n",
      "it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he\n",
      "thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured\n",
      "not to think, the more he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved\n",
      "within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his\n",
      "mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first\n",
      "position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through,\n",
      "\"Was it a dream or not?\"\n",

      "Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters\n",
      "more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned\n",
      "him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie\n",
      "awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could\n",
      "no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the\n",
      "wisest resolution in his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge, triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a\n",
      "deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.  Light flashed up in the room\n",
      "upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a\n",
      "hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his\n",
      "back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains\n",
      "of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a\n",
      "half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the\n",
      "unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now\n",
      "to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a\n",
      "child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural\n",
      "medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded\n",
      "from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.\n",
      "Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was\n",
      "white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\n",
      "it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were\n",
      "very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold\n",
      "were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately\n",
      "formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic\n",
      "of the purest white; and round its waist was bound\n",
      "a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held\n",
      "a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular\n",
      "contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed\n",
      "with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,\n",
      "that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear\n",
      "jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was\n",
      "doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\n",
      "great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing\n",
      "steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt\n",
      "sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,\n",
      "and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so\n",
      "the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a\n",
      "thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,\n",
      "now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a\n",
      "body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible\n",
      "in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the\n",
      "very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and\n",
      "clear as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to\n",
      "me?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if\n",
      "instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who, and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Long Past?\" inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish\n",
      "stature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Your past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if\n",
      "anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire\n",
      "to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out,\n",
      "with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough\n",
      "that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and\n",
      "force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon\n",
      "my brow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend\n",
      "or any knowledge of having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at\n",
      "any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what\n",
      "business brought him there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not\n",
      "help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been\n",
      "more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard\n",
      "him thinking, for it said immediately:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him\n",
      "gently by the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rise! and walk with me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the\n",
      "weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;\n",
      "that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below\n",
      "freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,\n",
      "dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at\n",
      "that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand,\n",
      "was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit\n",
      "made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bear but a touch of my hand there,\" said the Spirit,\n",
      "laying it upon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more\n",
      "than this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,\n",
      "and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either\n",
      "hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it\n",
      "was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished\n",
      "with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon\n",
      "the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,\n",
      "as he looked about him. \"I was bred in this place. I was\n",
      "a boy here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,\n",
      "though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still\n",
      "present to the old man's sense of feeling. He was conscious\n",
      "of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected\n",
      "with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares\n",
      "long, long, forgotten!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is\n",
      "that upon your cheek?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,\n",
      "that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him\n",
      "where he would.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could\n",
      "walk it blindfold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed\n",
      "the Ghost. \"Let us go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every\n",
      "gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared\n",
      "in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.\n",
      "Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them\n",
      "with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in\n",
      "country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys\n",
      "were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the\n",
      "broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air\n",
      "laughed to hear it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said\n",
      "the Ghost. \"They have no consciousness of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge\n",
      "knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond\n",
      "all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and\n",
      "his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled\n",
      "with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\n",
      "Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for\n",
      "their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?\n",
      "Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done\n",
      "to him?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A\n",
      "solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and\n",
      "soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little\n",
      "weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell\n",
      "hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken\n",
      "fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\n",
      "were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their\n",
      "gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;\n",
      "and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.\n",
      "Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for\n",
      "entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open\n",
      "doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,\n",
      "cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a\n",
      "chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow\n",
      "with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too\n",
      "much to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a\n",
      "door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and\n",
      "disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by\n",
      "lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely\n",
      "boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down\n",
      "upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he\n",
      "used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle\n",
      "from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the\n",
      "half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among\n",
      "the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle\n",
      "swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in\n",
      "the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening\n",
      "influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his\n",
      "younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in\n",
      "foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:\n",
      "stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and\n",
      "leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It's\n",
      "dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas\n",
      "time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,\n",
      "he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And\n",
      "Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his wild brother, Orson; there\n",
      "they go! And what's his name, who was put down in his\n",
      "drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see him!\n",
      "And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii;\n",
      "there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I'm glad of it.\n",
      "What business had he to be married to the Princess!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature\n",
      "on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between\n",
      "laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited\n",
      "face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in\n",
      "the city, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and\n",
      "yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the\n",
      "top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called\n",
      "him, when he came home again after sailing round the\n",
      "island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\n",
      "Crusoe?'  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't.\n",
      "It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running\n",
      "for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"\n",

      "Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his\n",
      "usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor\n",
      "boy!\" and cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his\n",

      "cuff: \"but it's too late now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy\n",
      "singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should\n",
      "like to have given him something: that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:\n",
      "saying as it did so, \"Let us see another Christmas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the\n",
      "room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk,\n",
      "the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the\n",
      "ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how\n",
      "all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you\n",
      "do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything\n",
      "had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all\n",
      "the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.\n",
      "Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of\n",
      "his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,\n",
      "came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and\n",
      "often kissing him, addressed him as her \"Dear, dear\n",
      "brother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the\n",
      "child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.\n",
      "\"To bring you home, home, home!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home, for good\n",
      "and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder\n",
      "than he used to be, that home's like Heaven! He spoke so\n",
      "gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that\n",
      "I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come\n",
      "home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach\n",
      "to bring you. And you're to be a man!\" said the child,\n",
      "opening her eyes, \"and are never to come back here; but\n",
      "first, we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have\n",
      "the merriest time in all the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his\n",
      "head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on\n",
      "tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her\n",
      "childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to\n",
      "go, accompanied her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master\n",
      "Scrooge's box, there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster\n",
      "himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious\n",
      "condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind\n",
      "by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his\n",
      "sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that\n",
      "ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial\n",
      "and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.\n",
      "Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a\n",
      "block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments\n",
      "of those dainties to the young people: at the same time,\n",
      "sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of \"something\"\n",
      "to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\n",
      "but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had\n",
      "rather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied\n",
      "on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster\n",
      "good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove\n",
      "gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the\n",
      "hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens\n",
      "like spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have\n",

      "\n",
      "\"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You're right. I will not\n",
      "gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think,\n",
      "children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One child,\" Scrooge returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly,\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although they had but that moment left the school behind\n",
      "them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city,\n",
      "where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy\n",
      "carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and\n",
      "tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by\n",
      "the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas\n",
      "time again; but it was evening, and the streets were\n",
      "lighted up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked\n",
      "Scrooge if he knew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh\n",
      "wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two\n",
      "inches taller he must have knocked his head against the\n",
      "ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig\n",
      "alive again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the\n",
      "clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his\n",
      "hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over\n",
      "himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and\n",
      "called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly\n",
      "in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost.\n",
      "\"Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached\n",
      "to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night.\n",
      "Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's\n",
      "have the shutters up,\" cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap\n",
      "of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack Robinson!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it!\n",
      "They charged into the street with the shutters--one, two,\n",
      "three--had 'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred\n",
      "'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back\n",
      "before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the\n",
      "high desk, with wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads,\n",
      "and let's have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup,\n",
      "Ebenezer!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared\n",
      "away, or couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking\n",
      "on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if\n",
      "it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was\n",
      "swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon\n",
      "the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and\n",
      "bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter's\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the\n",
      "lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty\n",
      "stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial\n",
      "smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and\n",
      "lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they\n",
      "broke. In came all the young men and women employed in\n",
      "the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the\n",
      "baker. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend,\n",
      "the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was\n",
      "suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying\n",
      "to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who\n",
      "was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.\n",
      "In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,\n",
      "some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;\n",
      "in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went,\n",
      "twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again\n",
      "the other way; down the middle and up again; round\n",
      "and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old\n",
      "top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top\n",
      "couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top\n",
      "couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When\n",
      "this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\n",
      "hands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well done!\" and the\n",
      "fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially\n",
      "provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his\n",
      "reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no\n",
      "dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home,\n",
      "exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\n",
      "resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more\n",
      "dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there\n",
      "was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece\n",
      "of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.\n",
      "But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast\n",
      "and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort\n",
      "of man who knew his business better than you or I could\n",
      "have told it him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\"  Then\n",
      "old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top\n",
      "couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them;\n",
      "three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were\n",
      "not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no\n",
      "notion of walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old\n",
      "Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would\n",
      "Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner\n",
      "in every sense of the term. If that's not high praise, tell me\n",
      "higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared to issue\n",
      "from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the\n",
      "dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given\n",
      "time, what would have become of them next. And when old\n",
      "Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;\n",
      "advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and\n",
      "curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to\n",
      "your place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly, that he appeared\n",
      "to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without\n",
      "a stagger.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side\n",
      "of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually\n",
      "as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.\n",
      "When everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did\n",
      "the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,\n",
      "and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a\n",
      "counter in the back-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a\n",
      "man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene,\n",
      "and with his former self. He corroborated everything,\n",
      "remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent\n",
      "the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the\n",
      "bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from\n",
      "them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious\n",
      "that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its\n",
      "head burnt very clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly\n",
      "folks so full of gratitude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,\n",
      "who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:\n",
      "and when he had done so, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of\n",
      "your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so\n",
      "much that he deserves this praise?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and\n",
      "speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.\n",
      "\"It isn't that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy\n",
      "or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a\n",
      "pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and\n",
      "looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is\n",
      "impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness\n",
      "he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Scrooge, \"No. I should like to be able to say\n",
      "a word or two to my clerk just now. That's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance\n",
      "to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by\n",
      "side in the open air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he\n",
      "could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again\n",
      "Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime\n",
      "of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later\n",
      "years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.\n",
      "There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which\n",
      "showed the passion that had taken root, and where the\n",
      "shadow of the growing tree would fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young\n",
      "girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears,\n",
      "which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of\n",
      "Christmas Past.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It matters little,\" she said, softly. \"To you, very little.\n",
      "Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort\n",
      "you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have\n",
      "no just cause to grieve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What Idol has displaced you?\" he rejoined.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A golden one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\" he said.\n",
      "\"There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and\n",
      "there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity\n",
      "as the pursuit of wealth!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You fear the world too much,\" she answered, gently.\n",
      "\"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being\n",
      "beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your\n",
      "nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion,\n",
      "Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What then?\" he retorted. \"Even if I have grown so\n",
      "much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were\n",
      "both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could\n",
      "improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You\n",
      "are changed. When it was made, you were another man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was a boy,\" he said impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you\n",
      "are,\" she returned. \"I am. That which promised happiness\n",
      "when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that\n",
      "we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of\n",
      "this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it,\n",
      "and can release you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have I ever sought release?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In words. No. Never.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In what, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another\n",
      "atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In\n",
      "everything that made my love of any worth or value in your\n",
      "sight. If this had never been between us,\" said the girl,\n",
      "looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; \"tell me,\n",
      "would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in\n",
      "spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, \"You think\n",
      "not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would gladly think otherwise if I could,\" she answered,\n",
      "\"Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this,\n",
      "I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you\n",
      "were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe\n",
      "that you would choose a dowerless girl--you who, in your\n",
      "very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or,\n",
      "choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your\n",
      "one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your\n",
      "repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I\n",
      "release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you\n",
      "once were.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was about to speak; but with her head turned from\n",
      "him, she resumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may--the memory of what is past half makes me\n",
      "hope you will--have pain in this. A very, very brief time,\n",
      "and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an\n",
      "unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you\n",
      "awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She left him, and they parted.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"One shadow more!\" exclaimed the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more!\" cried Scrooge. \"No more. I don't wish to\n",
      "see it. Show me no more!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms,\n",
      "and forced him to observe what happened next.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in another scene and place; a room, not very\n",
      "large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter\n",
      "fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge\n",
      "believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely\n",
      "matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this\n",
      "room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children\n",
      "there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\n",
      "and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not\n",
      "forty children conducting themselves like one, but every\n",
      "child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences\n",
      "were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;\n",
      "on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,\n",
      "and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\n",

      "and never come straight again. And yet I should\n",

      "questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have\n",
      "looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never\n",

      "which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should\n",

      "and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who\n",
      "came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys\n",
      "and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and\n",
      "the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!\n",

      "package was received! The terrible announcement that the\n",
      "baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying-pan\n",
      "into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having\n",
      "swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!\n",
      "The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy,\n",

      "He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an\n",
      "irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own\n",

      "light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\n",
      "hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than\n",
      "a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it\n",

      "\n",
      "The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange\n",
      "voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He\n",
      "obeyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his own room. There was no doubt about that.\n",
      "But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls\n",
      "and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a\n",

      "up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had\n",
      "never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and\n",
      "many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form\n",

      "cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,\n",
      "immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that\n",
      "made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy\n",
      "state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to\n",
      "see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's\n",

      "hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was\n",
      "bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any\n",
      "artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the\n",
      "garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other\n",
      "covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\n",
      "icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its\n",
      "genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,\n",
      "its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded\n",
      "round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword\n",
      "was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.\n",

      "the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood\n",
      "in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the\n",
      "weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and\n",
      "not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the\n",
      "pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of\n",
      "their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see\n",
      "it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting\n",
      "into artificial little snow-storms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows\n",
      "blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow\n",
      "upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;\n",
      "which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by\n",
      "the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed\n",
      "and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great\n",
      "streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace\n",
      "in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,\n",
      "and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,\n",
      "half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended\n",
      "in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great\n",
      "Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away\n",
      "to their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very cheerful\n",
      "in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\n",
      "cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest\n",
      "summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops\n",
      "were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another\n",
      "from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious\n",
      "snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--\n",
      "laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it\n",
      "went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the\n",
      "fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,\n",
      "pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats\n",
      "of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out\n",
      "into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were\n",
      "ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in\n",
      "the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking\n",
      "from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went\n",
      "by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were\n",
      "pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there\n",
      "were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence\n",
      "to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might\n",
      "water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy\n",
      "and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among\n",
      "the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered\n",
      "leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting\n",
      "off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great\n",
      "compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and\n",
      "beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after\n",
      "dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among\n",
      "these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\n",
      "stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was\n",
      "something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and\n",
      "round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps\n",
      "two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such\n",
      "glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the\n",
      "counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller\n",
      "parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled\n",
      "up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\n",
      "scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even\n",
      "that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so\n",
      "extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,\n",
      "the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and\n",
      "spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on\n",
      "feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs\n",
      "were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in\n",
      "modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that\n",
      "everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but\n",
      "the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful\n",
      "promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other\n",
      "at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left\n",
      "their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to\n",
      "fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in\n",
      "the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people\n",
      "were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which\n",
      "they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,\n",
      "worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws\n",
      "to peck at if they chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and\n",
      "chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in\n",
      "their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the\n",
      "same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and\n",
      "nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners\n",
      "to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers\n",
      "appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with\n",
      "Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the\n",
      "covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their\n",
      "dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind\n",
      "of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words\n",
      "between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he\n",
      "shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good\n",
      "humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame\n",
      "to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love\n",
      "it, so it was!\n",
      "\n",
      "In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and\n",
      "yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners\n",
      "and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of\n",
      "wet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked as\n",
      "if its stones were cooking too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from\n",
      "your torch?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is. My own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To any kindly given. To a poor one most.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why to a poor one most?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it needs it most.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, \"I wonder\n",
      "you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should\n",
      "desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent\n",
      "enjoyment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would deprive them of their means of dining every\n",
      "seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said\n",
      "to dine at all,\" said Scrooge. \"Wouldn't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?\" said\n",
      "Scrooge. \"And it comes to the same thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I seek!\" exclaimed the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your\n",
      "name, or at least in that of your family,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are some upon this earth of yours,\" returned the Spirit,\n",
      "\"who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion,\n",
      "pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness\n",
      "in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and\n",
      "kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge\n",
      "their doings on themselves, not us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on,\n",
      "invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the\n",
      "town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which\n",
      "Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding\n",
      "his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place\n",
      "with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\n",
      "gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible\n",
      "he could have done in any lofty hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in\n",
      "showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,\n",
      "generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor\n",
      "men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he\n",
      "went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and\n",
      "on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped\n",
      "to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his\n",
      "torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen \"Bob\" a-week\n",
      "himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his\n",
      "Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present\n",
      "blessed his four-roomed house!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out\n",
      "but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,\n",
      "which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and\n",
      "she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of\n",
      "her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter\n",
      "Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and\n",
      "getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private\n",
      "property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the\n",
      "day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly\n",
      "attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.\n",
      "And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing\n",
      "in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the\n",
      "goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious\n",
      "thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced\n",
      "about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the\n",
      "skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked\n",
      "him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,\n",
      "knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and\n",
      "peeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has ever got your precious father then?\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit. \"And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha\n",
      "warn't as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Martha, mother!\" said a girl, appearing as she\n",
      "spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Martha, mother!\" cried the two young Cratchits.\n",
      "\"Hurrah! There's such a goose, Martha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off\n",
      "her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,\" replied the\n",
      "girl, \"and had to clear away this morning, mother!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! Never mind so long as you are come,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit. \"Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have\n",
      "a warm, Lord bless ye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no! There's father coming,\" cried the two young\n",
      "Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha,\n",
      "hide!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,\n",
      "with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,\n",
      "hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned\n",
      "up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his\n",
      "shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and\n",
      "had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, where's our Martha?\" cried Bob Cratchit, looking\n",
      "round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not coming!\" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his\n",
      "high spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way\n",
      "from church, and had come home rampant. \"Not coming\n",
      "upon Christmas Day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only\n",
      "in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet\n",
      "door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits\n",
      "hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,\n",
      "that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit,\n",
      "when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had\n",
      "hugged his daughter to his heart's content.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and better. Somehow he\n",
      "gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the\n",
      "strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home,\n",
      "that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he\n",
      "was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember\n",
      "upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind\n",
      "men see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and\n",
      "trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing\n",
      "strong and hearty.\n",
      "\n",
      "His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back\n",
      "came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by\n",
      "his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while\n",
      "Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were\n",
      "capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot\n",
      "mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round\n",
      "and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter,\n",
      "and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the\n",
      "goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose\n",
      "the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a\n",
      "black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was\n",
      "something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made\n",
      "the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;\n",
      "Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;\n",
      "Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted\n",
      "the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny\n",
      "corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for\n",
      "everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard\n",
      "upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\n",
      "they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be\n",
      "helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was\n",
      "said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared\n",
      "to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the\n",
      "long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\n",
      "delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,\n",
      "excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with\n",
      "the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\n",
      "\n",
      "There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe\n",
      "there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and\n",
      "flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal\n",
      "admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,\n",
      "it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\n",
      "atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at\n",
      "last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest\n",
      "Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to\n",
      "the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss\n",
      "Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to\n",
      "bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should\n",
      "break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got\n",
      "over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they\n",
      "were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two\n",
      "young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\n",
      "supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of\n",
      "the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the\n",
      "cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next\n",
      "door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!\n",
      "That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\n",
      "entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,\n",
      "like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half\n",
      "of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with\n",
      "Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly\n",
      "too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that\n",
      "now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had\n",
      "had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had\n",
      "something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\n",
      "was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have\n",
      "been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed\n",
      "to hint at such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the\n",
      "hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the\n",
      "jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges\n",
      "were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the\n",
      "fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in\n",
      "what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and\n",
      "at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\n",
      "Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as\n",
      "golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with\n",
      "beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and\n",
      "cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which all the family re-echoed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless us every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat very close to his father's side upon his little\n",
      "stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he\n",
      "loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and\n",
      "dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt\n",
      "before, \"tell me if Tiny Tim will live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor\n",
      "chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully\n",
      "preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future,\n",
      "the child will die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Scrooge. \"Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he\n",
      "will be spared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none\n",
      "other of my race,\" returned the Ghost, \"will find him here.\n",
      "What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and\n",
      "decrease the surplus population.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by\n",
      "the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man,\" said the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not\n",
      "adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered\n",
      "What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what\n",
      "men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the\n",
      "sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live\n",
      "than millions like this poor man's child. Oh God! to hear\n",
      "the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life\n",
      "among his hungry brothers in the dust!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast\n",
      "his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on\n",
      "hearing his own name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob; \"I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the\n",
      "Founder of the Feast!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Founder of the Feast indeed!\" cried Mrs. Cratchit,\n",
      "reddening. \"I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece\n",
      "of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good\n",
      "appetite for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children! Christmas Day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,\" said she, \"on\n",
      "which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,\n",
      "unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert!\n",
      "Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" was Bob's mild answer, \"Christmas Day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,\" said\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit, \"not for his. Long life to him! A merry\n",
      "Christmas and a happy new year! He'll be very merry and\n",
      "very happy, I have no doubt!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of\n",
      "their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank\n",
      "it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge\n",
      "was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast\n",
      "a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full\n",
      "five minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than\n",
      "before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done\n",
      "with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his\n",
      "eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full\n",
      "five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed\n",
      "tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business;\n",
      "and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\n",
      "between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\n",
      "investments he should favour when he came into the receipt\n",
      "of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor\n",
      "apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work\n",
      "she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,\n",
      "and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a\n",
      "good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at\n",
      "home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some\n",
      "days before, and how the lord \"was much about as tall as\n",
      "Peter;\" at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you\n",
      "couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this\n",
      "time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and\n",
      "by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in\n",
      "the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,\n",
      "and sang it very well indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not\n",
      "a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes\n",
      "were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;\n",
      "and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside\n",
      "of a pawnbroker's. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased\n",
      "with one another, and contented with the time; and when\n",
      "they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings\n",
      "of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon\n",
      "them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty\n",
      "heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets,\n",
      "the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and\n",
      "all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of\n",
      "the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot\n",
      "plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep\n",
      "red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\n",
      "There all the children of the house were running out\n",
      "into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins,\n",
      "uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,\n",
      "were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and\n",
      "there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,\n",
      "and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\n",
      "neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw\n",
      "them enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on\n",
      "their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought\n",
      "that no one was at home to give them welcome when they\n",
      "got there, instead of every house expecting company, and\n",
      "piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\n",
      "the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and\n",
      "opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with\n",
      "a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything\n",
      "within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before,\n",
      "dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was\n",
      "dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly\n",
      "as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter\n",
      "that he had any company but Christmas!\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they\n",
      "stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses\n",
      "of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place\n",
      "of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,\n",
      "or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;\n",
      "and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.\n",
      "Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\n",
      "red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a\n",
      "sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in\n",
      "the thick gloom of darkest night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What place is this?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of\n",
      "the earth,\" returned the Spirit. \"But they know me. See!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they\n",
      "advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and\n",
      "stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a\n",
      "glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their\n",
      "children and their children's children, and another generation\n",
      "beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\n",
      "The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling\n",
      "of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a\n",
      "Christmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a\n",
      "boy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.\n",
      "So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite\n",
      "blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour\n",
      "sank again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his\n",
      "robe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither? Not\n",
      "to sea? To sea. To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw\n",
      "the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;\n",
      "and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it\n",
      "rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it\n",
      "had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league\n",
      "or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed,\n",
      "the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.\n",
      "Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds\n",
      "--born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the\n",
      "water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even here, two men who watched the light had made\n",
      "a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed\n",
      "out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their\n",
      "horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they\n",
      "wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and\n",
      "one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and\n",
      "scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship\n",
      "might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in\n",
      "itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea\n",
      "--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any\n",
      "shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman\n",
      "at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who\n",
      "had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations;\n",
      "but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\n",

      "on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared\n",
      "to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those\n",

      "to remember him.\n",

      "It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the\n",

      "was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown\n",
      "abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it\n",
      "was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear\n",

      "his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the\n",
      "most extravagant contortions: Scrooge's niece, by marriage,\n",
      "laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being\n",

      "\n",
      "She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,\n",
      "surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that\n",
      "seemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of\n",
      "good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another\n",

      "him; I couldn't be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers\n",
      "by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into\n",
      "his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us.\n",
      "What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\" interrupted\n",
      "Scrooge's niece. Everybody else said the same, and they\n",

      "they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well! I'm very glad to hear it,\" said Scrooge's nephew,\n",

      "\"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that\n",
      "the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making\n",
      "merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant\n",
      "moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses\n",
      "pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts,\n",
      "either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I\n",
      "mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he\n",
      "likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas\n",
      "till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it--I defy\n",

      "year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only\n",

      "that's something; and I think I shook him yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking\n",
      "Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much\n",
      "caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any\n",
      "rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the\n",
      "bottle joyously.\n",
      "\n",
      "After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical\n",
      "family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a\n",
      "Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who\n",
      "could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never\n",
      "swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face\n",
      "over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and\n",
      "played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:\n",
      "you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had\n",
      "been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the\n",
      "boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of\n",
      "Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the\n",
      "things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he\n",
      "softened more and more; and thought that if he could have\n",
      "listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the\n",
      "kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,\n",
      "without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\n",
      "Marley.\n",

      "But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After\n",
      "a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children\n",
      "sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its\n",
      "mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first\n",
      "a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I\n",
      "no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he\n",
      "had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done\n",
      "thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the\n",
      "Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after\n",
      "that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the\n",
      "credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,\n",
      "tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,\n",
      "smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,\n",
      "there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.\n",
      "He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up\n",
      "against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would\n",
      "have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would\n",
      "have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly\n",
      "have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.\n",
      "She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.\n",
      "But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her\n",
      "silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got\n",
      "her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his\n",
      "conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to\n",
      "know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her\n",
      "head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by\n",
      "pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain\n",
      "about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told\n",
      "him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in\n",
      "office, they were so very confidential together, behind the\n",
      "curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party,\n",
      "but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,\n",
      "in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close\n",
      "behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her\n",
      "love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.\n",
      "Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was\n",
      "very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat\n",
      "her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper\n",
      "could have told you. There might have been twenty people there,\n",
      "young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for\n",
      "wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that\n",
      "his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with\n",
      "his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;\n",
      "for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut\n",
      "in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in\n",
      "his head to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,\n",
      "and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like\n",
      "a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But\n",
      "this the Spirit said could not be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is a new game,\" said Scrooge. \"One half hour,\n",
      "Spirit, only one!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew\n",
      "had to think of something, and the rest must find out what;\n",
      "he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case\n",
      "was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,\n",
      "elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live\n",
      "animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\n",
      "animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,\n",
      "and lived in London, and walked about the streets,\n",
      "and wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody, and\n",
      "didn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,\n",
      "and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a\n",
      "tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh\n",
      "question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a\n",
      "fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that\n",
      "he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last\n",
      "the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!\"\n",

      "Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal\n",
      "sentiment, though some objected that the reply to \"Is it a\n",
      "bear?\" ought to have been \"Yes;\" inasmuch as an answer\n",
      "in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts\n",

      "\n",
      "Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light\n",
      "of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious\n",
      "company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech,\n",
      "if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene\n",
      "passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\n",
      "nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they\n",
      "visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood\n",
      "beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands,\n",
      "and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they\n",
      "were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was\n",
      "rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every\n",
      "refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not\n",
      "made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his\n",
      "blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge\n",
      "had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared\n",
      "to be condensed into the space of time they passed\n",
      "together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained\n",
      "unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly\n",
      "older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of\n",
      "it, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when,\n",
      "looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place,\n",

      "wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where\n",
      "graceful youth should have filled their features out, and\n",
      "touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled\n",
      "hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and\n",

      "of such enormous magnitude.\n",

      "\"Spirit! are they yours?\" Scrooge could say no more.\n",
      "\n",

      "and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for\n",
      "on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the\n",
      "writing be erased. Deny it!\" cried the Spirit, stretching out\n",
      "its hand towards the city. \"Slander those who tell it ye!\n",
      "Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.\n",
      "And bide the end!\"\n",

      "scatter gloom and mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed\n",
      "its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible\n",
      "save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been\n",
      "difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it\n",
      "from the darkness by which it was surrounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside\n",
      "him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a\n",
      "solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither\n",
      "spoke nor moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To\n",

      "observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him\n",

      "\"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is\n",

      "on, Spirit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.\n",
      "Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him\n",
      "up, he thought, and carried him along.\n",
      "\n",
      "They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather\n",
      "seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its\n",
      "own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on\n",
      "'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down,\n",
      "and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\n",
      "groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully\n",
      "with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had\n",
      "seen them often.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.\n",
      "Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge\n",
      "advanced to listen to their talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I\n",
      "don't know much about it, either way. I only know he's\n",
      "dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When did he die?\" inquired another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Last night, I believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what was the matter with him?\" asked a third,\n",
      "taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box.\n",
      "\"I thought he'd never die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God knows,\" said the first, with a yawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has he done with his money?\" asked a red-faced\n",
      "gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his\n",
      "nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't heard,\" said the man with the large chin,\n",
      "yawning again. \"Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't\n",
      "left it to me. That's all I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,\" said the same\n",
      "speaker; \"for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go\n",
      "to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,\" observed the\n",
      "gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. \"But I must\n",
      "be fed, if I make one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\"\n",
      "said the first speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I\n",
      "never eat lunch. But I'll offer to go, if anybody else will.\n",
      "When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't\n",
      "his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak\n",
      "whenever we met. Bye, bye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with\n",
      "other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the\n",
      "Spirit for an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed\n",
      "to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking\n",
      "that the explanation might lie here.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business:\n",
      "very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point\n",
      "always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point\n",
      "of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you?\" said one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you?\" returned the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at\n",
      "last, hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I am told,\" returned the second. \"Cold, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seasonable for Christmas time. You're not a skater, I\n",
      "suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not another word. That was their meeting, their\n",
      "conversation, and their parting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the\n",
      "Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so\n",
      "trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden\n",
      "purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.\n",
      "They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the\n",
      "death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this\n",
      "Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of any\n",
      "one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could\n",
      "apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they\n",
      "applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement,\n",
      "he resolved to treasure up every word he heard,\n",
      "and everything he saw; and especially to observe the\n",
      "shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation\n",
      "that the conduct of his future self would give him\n",
      "the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these\n",
      "riddles easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked about in that very place for his own image; but\n",
      "another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the\n",
      "clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he\n",
      "saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured\n",
      "in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however;\n",
      "for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and\n",
      "thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried\n",
      "out in this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its\n",
      "outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his\n",
      "thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and\n",
      "its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes\n",
      "were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel\n",
      "very cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part\n",
      "of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before,\n",
      "although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The\n",
      "ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;\n",
      "the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and\n",
      "archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\n",
      "smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the\n",
      "whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed,\n",
      "beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags,\n",
      "bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor\n",
      "within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges,\n",
      "files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets\n",
      "that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in\n",
      "mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\n",
      "sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\n",
      "charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal,\n",
      "nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the\n",
      "cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous\n",
      "tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury\n",
      "of calm retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this\n",
      "man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the\n",
      "shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,\n",
      "similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by\n",
      "a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight\n",
      "of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each\n",
      "other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which\n",
      "the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three\n",
      "burst into a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\" cried she who\n",
      "had entered first. \"Let the laundress alone to be the second;\n",
      "and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look\n",
      "here, old Joe, here's a chance! If we haven't all three met\n",
      "here without meaning it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You couldn't have met in a better place,\" said old Joe,\n",
      "removing his pipe from his mouth. \"Come into the parlour.\n",
      "You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other\n",
      "two an't strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop.\n",
      "Ah! How it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of metal\n",
      "in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's\n",
      "no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We're all suitable\n",
      "to our calling, we're well matched. Come into the\n",
      "parlour. Come into the parlour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The\n",
      "old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and\n",
      "having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the\n",
      "stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he did this, the woman who had already spoken\n",
      "threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting\n",
      "manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and\n",
      "looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?\" said the\n",
      "woman. \"Every person has a right to take care of themselves.\n",
      "He always did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true, indeed!\" said the laundress. \"No man\n",
      "more so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid,\n",
      "woman; who's the wiser? We're not going to pick holes in\n",
      "each other's coats, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed!\" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.\n",
      "\"We should hope not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, then!\" cried the woman. \"That's enough.\n",
      "Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these?\n",
      "Not a dead man, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old\n",
      "screw,\" pursued the woman, \"why wasn't he natural in his\n",
      "lifetime? If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look\n",
      "after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying\n",
      "gasping out his last there, alone by himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the truest word that ever was spoke,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Dilber. \"It's a judgment on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\" replied the\n",
      "woman; \"and it should have been, you may depend upon it,\n",
      "if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that\n",
      "bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out\n",
      "plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to\n",
      "see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves,\n",
      "before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle,\n",
      "Joe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;\n",
      "and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first,\n",
      "produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two,\n",
      "a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no\n",
      "great value, were all. They were severally examined and\n",
      "appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed\n",
      "to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a\n",
      "total when he found there was nothing more to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's your account,\" said Joe, \"and I wouldn't give\n",
      "another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it.\n",
      "Who's next?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing\n",
      "apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of\n",
      "sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall\n",
      "in the same manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine,\n",
      "and that's the way I ruin myself,\" said old Joe. \"That's\n",
      "your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made\n",
      "it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and knock\n",
      "off half-a-crown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now undo my bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience\n",
      "of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,\n",
      "dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward\n",
      "on her crossed arms. \"Bed-curtains!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and\n",
      "all, with him lying there?\" said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes I do,\" replied the woman. \"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and\n",
      "you'll certainly do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything\n",
      "in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He\n",
      "was, I promise you, Joe,\" returned the woman coolly. \"Don't\n",
      "drop that oil upon the blankets, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His blankets?\" asked Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose else's do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He\n",
      "isn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?\" said\n",
      "old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I\n",
      "an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for\n",
      "such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that\n",
      "shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor\n",
      "a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine one too.\n",
      "They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied\n",
      "the woman with a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to\n",
      "do it, but I took it off again. If calico an't good enough for\n",
      "such a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything. It's quite\n",
      "as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than he did\n",
      "in that one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat\n",
      "grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by\n",
      "the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and\n",
      "disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they\n",
      "had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman, when old Joe,\n",
      "producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their\n",
      "several gains upon the ground. \"This is the end of it, you\n",
      "see! He frightened every one away from him when he was\n",
      "alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. \"I\n",
      "see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own.\n",
      "My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is\n",
      "this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now\n",
      "he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which,\n",
      "beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up,\n",
      "which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful\n",
      "language.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with\n",
      "any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience\n",
      "to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it\n",
      "was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon\n",
      "the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept,\n",
      "uncared for, was the body of this man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand\n",
      "was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted\n",
      "that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon\n",
      "Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought\n",
      "of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;\n",
      "but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss\n",
      "the spectre at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar\n",
      "here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy\n",
      "command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved,\n",
      "revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair\n",
      "to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\n",
      "not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;\n",
      "it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the\n",
      "hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,\n",
      "and tender; and the pulse a man's. Strike, Shadow, strike!\n",
      "And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow\n",
      "the world with life immortal!\n",
      "\n",
      "No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and\n",
      "yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He\n",
      "thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be\n",
      "his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?\n",
      "They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a\n",
      "woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this\n",
      "or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be\n",
      "kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was\n",
      "a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What\n",
      "they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so\n",
      "restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it,\n",
      "I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do\n",
      "it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have\n",
      "not the power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again it seemed to look upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion\n",
      "caused by this man's death,\" said Scrooge quite agonised,\n",
      "\"show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a\n",
      "moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room\n",
      "by daylight, where a mother and her children were.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;\n",
      "for she walked up and down the room; started at every\n",
      "sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;\n",
      "tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly\n",
      "bear the voices of the children in their play.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried\n",
      "to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was\n",
      "careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was\n",
      "a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight\n",
      "of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for\n",
      "him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news\n",
      "(which was not until after a long silence), he appeared\n",
      "embarrassed how to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it good?\" she said, \"or bad?\"--to help him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bad,\" he answered.\n",

      "round the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as\n",
      "still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter,\n",
      "who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters\n",
      "were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\n",

      "\n",
      "Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not\n",

      "go on?\n",
      "\n",

      "must be near his time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book.\n",

      "these few last evenings, mother.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter\n",
      "--he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea\n",

      "help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got\n",
      "upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against\n",
      "his face, as if they said, \"Don't mind it, father. Don't be\n",
      "grieved!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to\n",

      "They would be done long before Sunday, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his\n",

      "cried Bob. \"My little child!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he\n",
      "could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther\n",
      "apart perhaps than they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above,\n",
      "which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.\n",
      "There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were\n",
      "signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat\n",
      "down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed\n",
      "himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\n",
      "had happened, and went down again quite happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother\n",
      "working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness\n",
      "of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but\n",
      "once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing\n",
      "that he looked a little--\"just a little down you know,\" said\n",
      "Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. \"On\n",
      "which,\" said Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman\n",
      "you ever heard, I told him. 'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr.\n",
      "Cratchit,' he said, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife.'\n",
      "By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don't know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knew what, my dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that you were a good wife,\" replied Bob.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everybody knows that!\" said Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well observed, my boy!\" cried Bob. \"I hope they\n",
      "do. 'Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. If I\n",
      "can be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me\n",
      "his card, 'that's where I live. Pray come to me.' Now, it\n",
      "wasn't,\" cried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might be\n",
      "able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was\n",
      "quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our\n",
      "Tiny Tim, and felt with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure he's a good soul!\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would be surer of it, my dear,\" returned Bob, \"if\n",
      "you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--\n",
      "mark what I say!--if he got Peter a better situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only hear that, Peter,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then,\" cried one of the girls, \"Peter will be keeping\n",
      "company with some one, and setting up for himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get along with you!\" retorted Peter, grinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's just as likely as not,\" said Bob, \"one of these days;\n",
      "though there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But however\n",
      "and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we\n",
      "shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this\n",
      "first parting that there was among us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, father!\" cried they all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I know,\" said Bob, \"I know, my dears, that when\n",
      "we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he\n",

      "ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, never, father!\" they all cried again.\n",

      "Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the\n",
      "two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook\n",

      "God!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spectre,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our\n",
      "parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not\n",
      "how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as\n",
      "before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there\n",
      "seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were\n",
      "in the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed\n",
      "him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything,\n",
      "but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,\n",
      "until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now,\n",
      "is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length\n",
      "of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be,\n",
      "in days to come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The house is yonder,\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"Why do you\n",
      "point away?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The inexorable finger underwent no change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked\n",
      "in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was\n",
      "not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.\n",
      "The Phantom pointed as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither\n",
      "he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.\n",
      "He paused to look round before entering.\n",
      "\n",
      "A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name\n",
      "he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a\n",
      "worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and\n",
      "weeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up\n",
      "with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A\n",
      "worthy place!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to\n",
      "One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was\n",
      "exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new\n",
      "meaning in its solemn shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\"\n",
      "said Scrooge, \"answer me one question. Are these the\n",
      "shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of\n",
      "things that May be, only?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which\n",
      "it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if\n",
      "persevered in, they must lead,\" said Scrooge. \"But if the\n",
      "courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is\n",
      "thus with what you show me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit was immovable as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and\n",
      "following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected\n",
      "grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I that man who lay upon the bed?\" he cried, upon\n",
      "his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger still was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, \"hear me!\n",
      "I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must\n",
      "have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I\n",
      "am past all hope!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time the hand appeared to shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Spirit,\" he pursued, as down upon the ground he\n",
      "fell before it: \"Your nature intercedes for me, and pities\n",
      "me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you\n",
      "have shown me, by an altered life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind hand trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it\n",
      "all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the\n",
      "Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I\n",
      "will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I\n",
      "may sponge away the writing on this stone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to\n",
      "free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.\n",
      "The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate\n",
      "reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress.\n",
      "It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "STAVE V:  THE END OF IT\n",
      "\n",
      "YES! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own,\n",
      "the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time\n",
      "before him was his own, to make amends in!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!\"\n",
      "Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. \"The Spirits\n",

      "it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions,\n",

      "\"I don't know what to do!\" cried Scrooge, laughing and\n",
      "crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of\n",
      "himself with his stockings. \"I am as light as a feather, I\n",
      "am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I\n",

      "\n",
      "Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so\n",

      "wonderful knocker!--Here's the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop!\n",
      "How are you! Merry Christmas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his\n",
      "legs, that bird. He would have snapped 'em short off in a\n",
      "minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\"\n",

      "which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which\n",
      "he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed\n",
      "the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle\n",
      "with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\n",
      "chuckled till he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to\n",
      "shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when\n",
      "you don't dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the\n",
      "end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of\n",
      "sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and at last got out\n",
      "into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth,\n",
      "as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present;\n",
      "and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded\n",
      "every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly\n",
      "pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows\n",
      "said, \"Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!\"\n",
      "And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe\n",
      "sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he\n",
      "beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his\n",
      "counting-house the day before, and said, \"Scrooge and Marley's, I\n",
      "believe?\"  It sent a pang across his heart to think how this\n",
      "old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he\n",
      "knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and\n",
      "taking the old gentleman by both his hands. \"How do you\n",
      "do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of\n",
      "you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Scrooge?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Scrooge. \"That is my name, and I fear it\n",
      "may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon.\n",
      "And will you have the goodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in\n",
      "his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord bless me!\" cried the gentleman, as if his breath\n",
      "were taken away. \"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please,\" said Scrooge. \"Not a farthing less. A\n",
      "great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you.\n",
      "Will you do me that favour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said the other, shaking hands with him.\n",
      "\"I don't know what to say to such munifi--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge. \"Come\n",
      "and see me. Will you come and see me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will!\" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he\n",
      "meant to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank'ee,\" said Scrooge. \"I am much obliged to you.\n",
      "I thank you fifty times. Bless you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to church, and walked about the streets, and\n",
      "watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children\n",
      "on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into\n",
      "the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found\n",
      "that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never\n",
      "dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so\n",
      "much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps\n",
      "towards his nephew's house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the\n",
      "courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and\n",
      "did it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the\n",
      "girl. Nice girl! Very.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is he, my love?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll\n",
      "show you up-stairs, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank'ee. He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand\n",
      "already on the dining-room lock. \"I'll go in here, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door.\n",
      "They were looking at the table (which was spread out in\n",
      "great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous\n",
      "on such points, and like to see that everything is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fred!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!\n",
      "Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting\n",
      "in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done\n",
      "it, on any account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why bless my soul!\" cried Fred, \"who's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner.\n",
      "Will you let me in, Fred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.\n",
      "He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier.\n",
      "His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he\n",
      "came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did\n",
      "every one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful\n",
      "games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was\n",
      "early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob\n",
      "Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his\n",
      "heart upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No\n",
      "Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen\n",
      "minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his\n",
      "door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter\n",
      "too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his\n",
      "pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as\n",
      "near as he could feign it. \"What do you mean by coming\n",
      "here at this time of day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Bob. \"I am behind my time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are?\" repeated Scrooge. \"Yes. I think you are.\n",
      "Step this way, sir, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's only once a year, sir,\" pleaded Bob, appearing from\n",
      "the Tank. \"It shall not be repeated. I was making rather\n",
      "merry yesterday, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge, \"I\n",
      "am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And\n",
      "therefore,\" he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving\n",
      "Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into\n",
      "the Tank again; \"and therefore I am about to raise your\n",
      "salary!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He\n",
      "had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it,\n",
      "holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help\n",
      "and a strait-waistcoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge, with an earnestness\n",
      "that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the\n",
      "back. \"A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I\n",
      "have given you, for many a year! I'll raise your salary, and\n",
      "endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss\n",
      "your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\n",
      "smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another\n",
      "coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and\n",
      "infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was\n",
      "a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a\n",
      "master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or\n",
      "any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old\n",
      "world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him,\n",
      "but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was\n",
      "wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this\n",
      "globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill\n",
      "of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these\n",
      "would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\n",
      "should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in\n",
      "less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was\n",
      "quite enough for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon\n",
      "the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was\n",
      "always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas\n",
      "well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that\n",

      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",

      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",

      "passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\n",
      "out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\n",
      "flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\n",
      "through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\n",

      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",

      "door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\n",
      "key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\n",

      "before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\n",
      "splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\n",
      "she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\n",
      "railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\n",
      "her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\n",
      "to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\n",
      "sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\n",
      "of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\n",
      "soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\n",
      "she was nine feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\n",
      "to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\n",
      "being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\n",
      "sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n",
      "off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\n",
      "it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\n",
      "she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n",
      "slipped in like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\n",
      "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\n",
      "likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\n",
      "began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\n",
      "of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\n",
      "way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\n",
      "she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\n",
      "a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\n",
      "but it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\n",
      "a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\n",
      "her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\n",
      "anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\n",
      "was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\n",
      "sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\n",
      "fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\n",
      "had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\n",
      "cats.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\n",
      "_you_ like cats if you were me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\n",
      "about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\n",
      "take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\n",
      "quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\n",
      "in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\n",
      "paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\n",
      "nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\n",
      "pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\n",
      "over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\n",
      "about her any more if you’d rather not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\n",
      "tail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n",
      "_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\n",
      "again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n",
      "conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\n",
      "answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\n",
      "our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\n",
      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\n",
      "you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\n",
      "of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\n",
      "know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\n",
      "it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n",
      "“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\n",
      "from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\n",
      "pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",
      "won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\n",
      "Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\n",
      "was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\n",
      "trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\n",
      "history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n",
      "birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\n",
      "Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\n",
      "led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\n",
      "birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\n",
      "to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\n",
      "consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\n",
      "natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\n",
      "she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\n",
      "with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\n",
      "older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\n",
      "without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\n",
      "tell its age, there was no more to be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\n",
      "called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\n",
      "you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\n",
      "Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\n",
      "felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\n",
      "is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\n",
      "the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\n",
      "to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\n",
      "accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\n",
      "Mercia and Northumbria—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\n",
      "you speak?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\n",
      "the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\n",
      "Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\n",
      "what ‘it’ means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\n",
      "Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\n",
      "archbishop find?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\n",
      "it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\n",
      "the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\n",
      "of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\n",
      "turning to Alice as it spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\n",
      "dry me at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\n",
      "that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\n",
      "remedies—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\n",
      "those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\n",
      "the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\n",
      "tittered audibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\n",
      "that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\n",
      "know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\n",
      "speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\n",
      "as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\n",
      "tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\n",
      "shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\n",
      "along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\n",
      "away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\n",
      "liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\n",
      "when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\n",
      "again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\n",
      "crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\n",
      "thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\n",
      "forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\n",
      "pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\n",
      "said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\n",
      "finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\n",
      "confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\n",
      "pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\n",
      "not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\n",
      "one a-piece, all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\n",
      "your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\n",
      "presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\n",
      "thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\n",
      "cheered.\n",

      "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\n",
      "that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\n",
      "to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\n",
      "she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\n",
      "begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\n",
      "it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\n",
      "would be offended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\n",
      "sighing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\n",
      "at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\n",
      "puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\n",
      "tale was something like this:—\n",
      "\n",
      "         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\n",
      "         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\n",
      "         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\n",
      "         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\n",
      "         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\n",
      "         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\n",
      "         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\n",
      "you thinking of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\n",
      "bend, I think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\n",
      "anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\n",
      "walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\n",
      "you know!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mouse only growled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\n",
      "the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\n",
      "shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\n",
      "quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\n",
      "her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\n",
      "_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\n",
      "snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\n",
      "addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\n",
      "Lory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n",
      "“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\n",
      "can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\n",
      "she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\n",
      "birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\n",
      "carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\n",
      "doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\n",
      "to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\n",
      "bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\n",
      "alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\n",
      "tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\n",
      "cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\n",
      "any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\n",
      "lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\n",
      "little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\n",
      "eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\n",
      "coming back to finish his story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\n",
      "anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\n",
      "it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\n",
      "my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\n",
      "ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\n",
      "gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\n",
      "they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\n",
      "her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\n",
      "little door, had vanished completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\n",
      "called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\n",
      "doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\n",
      "a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\n",
      "at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\n",
      "mistake it had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\n",
      "surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\n",
      "his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",
      "real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\n",
      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\n",
      "don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\n",
      "if it began ordering people about like that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\n",
      "pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\n",
      "gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\n",
      "little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\n",
      "this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\n",
      "and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\n",
      "happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\n",
      "I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\n",
      "again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",
      "and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\n",
      "down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\n",
      "grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\n",
      "drunk quite so much!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\n",
      "yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\n",
      "that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\n",
      "one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\n",
      "when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\n",
      "now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\n",
      "then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\n",
      "lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\n",
      "for any lesson-books!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\n",
      "making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\n",
      "she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\n",
      "large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\n",
      "help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\n",
      "of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\n",
      "they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n",
      "_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\n",
      "talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\n",
      "ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\n",
      "together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\n",
      "well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\n",
      "rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\n",
      "Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\n",
      "fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\n",
      "it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\n",
      "you’re to go down the chimney!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\n",
      "herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\n",
      "Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "I _think_ I can kick a little!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\n",
      "she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\n",
      "to see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\n",
      "then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\n",
      "now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\n",
      "us all about it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\n",
      "Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\n",
      "called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\n",
      "wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\n",
      "roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\n",
      "this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\n",
      "again!” which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\n",
      "_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\n",
      "must make me smaller, I suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\n",
      "through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\n",
      "little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\n",
      "was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\n",
      "second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\n",
      "will be the best plan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\n",
      "thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\n",
      "it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\n",
      "might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\n",
      "spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\n",
      "and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\n",
      "I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\n",
      "suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\n",
      "question is, what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\n",
      "caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\n",
      "smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\n",
      "silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\n",
      "addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\n",
      "who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\n",
      "changed several times since then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\n",
      "yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\n",
      "not myself, you see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\n",
      "“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, won’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\n",
      "is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\n",
      "think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\n",
      "important to say!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\n",
      "and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\n",
      "some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\n",
      "its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\n",
      "think you’re changed, do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\n",
      "used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\n",
      "came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice folded her hands, and began:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\n",
      "    “And your hair has become very white;\n",
      "And yet you incessantly stand on your head—\n",
      "    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\n",
      "    “I feared it might injure the brain;\n",
      "But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\n",
      "    Why, I do it again and again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\n",
      "    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\n",
      "Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\n",
      "    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n",
      "    “I kept all my limbs very supple\n",
      "By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\n",
      "    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\n",
      "    For anything tougher than suet;\n",
      "Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\n",
      "    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\n",
      "    And argued each case with my wife;\n",
      "And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n",
      "    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\n",
      "    That your eye was as steady as ever;\n",
      "Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\n",
      "    What made you so awfully clever?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\n",
      "    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\n",
      "Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\n",
      "    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\n",
      "words have got altered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\n",
      "and there was silence for some minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\n",
      "doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\n",
      "before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\n",
      "mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\n",
      "rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\n",
      "thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\n",
      "offended!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\n",
      "hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\n",
      "minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\n",
      "yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\n",
      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",
      "“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\n",
      "grow shorter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\n",
      "aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\n",
      "trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\n",
      "perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\n",
      "last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\n",
      "off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\n",
      "violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",
      "lefthand bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n",
      "\n",
      "    *      *      *      *      *      *\n",
      "\n",
      "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\n",
      "changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\n",
      "were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\n",
      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\n",
      "sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\n",
      "shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\n",
      "She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\n",
      "except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\n",
      "she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\n",
      "her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\n",
      "had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\n",
      "going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\n",
      "the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\n",
      "hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\n",
      "face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\n",
      "tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\n",
      "seems to suit them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\n",
      "hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\n",
      "serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\n",
      "saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\n",
      "“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\n",
      "haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\n",
      "see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\n",
      "Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\n",
      "should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\n",
      "from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\n",
      "invent something!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\n",
      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n",
      "_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\n",
      "no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\n",
      "tasted an egg!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\n",
      "child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\n",
      "they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\n",
      "looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\n",
      "me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\n",
      "looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\n",
      "_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\n",
      "as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\n",
      "and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\n",
      "she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\n",
      "and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\n",
      "the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\n",
      "she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\n",
      "done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\n",
      "going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\n",
      "right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\n",
      "_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\n",
      "upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n",
      "“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\n",
      "_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\n",
      "began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\n",
      "near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\n",
      "wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",
      "fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\n",
      "another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\n",
      "all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\n",
      "about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\n",
      "Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\n",
      "tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\n",
      "An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\n",
      "for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\n",
      "noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\n",
      "and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\n",
      "if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\n",
      "know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\n",
      "this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\n",
      "she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\n",
      "head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\n",
      "she repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\n",
      "question, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\n",
      "dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\n",
      "It’s enough to drive one crazy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",
      "remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\n",
      "days and days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\n",
      "in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\n",
      "stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\n",
      "herself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\n",
      "occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\n",
      "on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\n",
      "your cat grins like that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\n",

      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\n",

      "baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\n",
      "know that cats _could_ grin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\n",
      "pleased to have got into a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\n",
      "in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\n",
      "unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\n",
      "get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\n",
      "think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\n",
      "earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\n",

      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",
      "be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\n",
      "is it twelve? I—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\n",
      "figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\n",
      "sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\n",
      "the end of every line:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak roughly to your little boy,\n",
      "    And beat him when he sneezes:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\n",
      "the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\n",
      "that Alice could hardly hear the words:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I speak severely to my boy,\n",
      "    I beat him when he sneezes;\n",
      "For he can thoroughly enjoy\n",

      "flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\n",
      "croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\n",
      "threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\n",
      "little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n",
      "“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\n",
      "snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\n",
      "itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\n",
      "the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\n",
      "twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\n",
      "ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\n",
      "out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\n",
      "thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\n",
      "murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\n",
      "little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n",
      "“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\n",
      "expressing yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\n",
      "to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\n",
      "a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\n",
      "its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\n",
      "not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\n",
      "sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\n",
      "were any tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\n",
      "said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\n",
      "now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\n",
      "with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\n",
      "violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\n",
      "there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\n",
      "a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\n",
      "further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\n",
      "trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\n",
      "herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\n",
      "rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\n",
      "was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\n",
      "a tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\n",
      "thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\n",
      "felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\n",
      "whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\n",
      "wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\n",
      "“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\n",
      "enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\n",
      "question. “What sort of people live about here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\n",
      "a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\n",
      "March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\n",
      "You’re mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\n",
      "do you know that you’re mad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose so,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\n",
      "and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\n",
      "and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\n",
      "Queen to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\n",
      "yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\n",
      "things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\n",
      "it suddenly appeared again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\n",
      "forgotten to ask.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\n",
      "in a natural way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\n",
      "appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\n",
      "which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\n",
      "said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\n",
      "perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\n",
      "was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\n",
      "again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\n",
      "and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\n",
      "beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\n",
      "remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\n",
      "grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\n",
      "the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\n",
      "chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\n",
      "was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\n",
      "nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\n",
      "to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\n",
      "timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\n",
      "I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\n",
      "March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\n",
      "between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\n",
      "cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\n",
      "uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\n",
      "I suppose it doesn’t mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\n",
      "one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\n",
      "Alice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\n",
      "she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n",
      "“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\n",
      "many more than three.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\n",
      "Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\n",
      "speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\n",
      "severity; “it’s very rude.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\n",
      "was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\n",
      "begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly so,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\n",
      "say—that’s the same thing, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\n",
      "say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\n",
      "I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\n",
      "talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\n",
      "as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\n",
      "Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\n",
      "writing-desks, which wasn’t much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\n",
      "is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\n",
      "pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\n",
      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\n",
      "the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\n",
      "“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",
      "nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\n",
      "you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\n",
      "funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\n",
      "tell what o’clock it is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\n",
      "year it is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\n",
      "stays the same year for such a long time together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\n",
      "sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\n",
      "understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\n",
      "hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\n",
      "eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\n",
      "time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\n",
      "answers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\n",
      "about wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\n",
      "contemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\n",
      "time when I learn music.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\n",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\n",
      "hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\n",
      "time for dinner!”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\n",
      "shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\n",
      "half-past one as long as you liked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\n",
      "quarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\n",
      "with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\n",
      "given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n",
      "How I wonder what you’re at!’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the song, perhaps?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",
      "                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n",
      "“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\n",
      "had to pinch it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\n",
      "Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\n",
      "head!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\n",
      "do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\n",
      "tea-things are put out here?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\n",
      "and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\n",
      "to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n",
      "“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\n",
      "proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\n",
      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\n",
      "hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\n",
      "before it’s done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\n",
      "in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\n",
      "they lived at the bottom of a well—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\n",
      "in questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\n",
      "two.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\n",
      "“they’d have been ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\n",
      "living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\n",
      "why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\n",
      "take more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\n",
      "take _more_ than nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\n",
      "some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\n",
      "repeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\n",
      "said, “It was a treacle-well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\n",
      "Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\n",
      "remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\n",
      "dare say there may be _one_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\n",
      "go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\n",
      "you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\n",
      "moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\n",
      "place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\n",
      "advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\n",
      "before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\n",
      "cautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\n",
      "from?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\n",
      "think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\n",
      "to notice this last remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\n",
      "some time without interrupting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\n",
      "its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\n",
      "things—everything that begins with an M—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why with an M?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\n",
      "doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\n",
      "little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\n",
      "mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\n",
      "things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\n",
      "drawing of a muchness?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\n",
      "think—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\n",
      "great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\n",
      "neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\n",
      "looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\n",
      "the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\n",
      "the teapot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\n",
      "way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\n",
      "all my life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\n",
      "leading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\n",
      "everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\n",
      "in she went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\n",
      "glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\n",
      "and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\n",
      "led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n",
      "(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\n",
      "high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\n",
      "herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\n",
      "and the cool fountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\n",
      "growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\n",
      "painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\n",
      "went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\n",
      "one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\n",
      "like that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\n",
      "elbow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\n",
      "blame on others!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\n",
      "yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\n",
      "bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\n",
      "things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\n",
      "them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\n",
      "and all of them bowed low.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\n",
      "painting those roses?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\n",
      "voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n",
      "_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\n",
      "was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\n",
      "you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\n",
      "moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\n",
      "out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\n",
      "themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\n",
      "and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\n",
      "three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\n",
      "corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\n",
      "diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\n",
      "the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\n",
      "jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\n",
      "ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\n",
      "and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\n",
      "hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\n",
      "by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\n",
      "the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\n",
      "grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\n",
      "like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\n",
      "of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\n",
      "procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\n",
      "faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\n",
      "and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\n",
      "at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\n",
      "Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\n",
      "Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\n",
      "but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\n",
      "all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\n",
      "who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\n",
      "their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\n",
      "the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\n",
      "or courtiers, or three of her own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\n",
      "no business of _mine_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\n",
      "moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\n",
      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\n",
      "dear: she is only a child!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\n",
      "them over!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\n",
      "gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\n",
      "the royal children, and everybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\n",
      "turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\n",
      "here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\n",
      "down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n",
      "“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\n",
      "soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\n",
      "to Alice for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\n",
      "flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\n",
      "minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\n",
      "in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\n",
      "evidently meant for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!” shouted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\n",
      "wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\n",
      "walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\n",
      "anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\n",
      "tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\n",
      "sentence of execution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\n",
      "‘What for?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\n",
      "scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\n",
      "tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\n",
      "Queen said—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\n",
      "in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\n",
      "hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\n",
      "themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\n",
      "under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\n",
      "had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\n",
      "hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\n",
      "up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\n",
      "bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\n",
      "going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\n",
      "had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\n",
      "this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\n",
      "always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\n",
      "soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\n",
      "the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\n",
      "shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\n",
      "dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n",
      "“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\n",
      "one left alive!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\n",
      "appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\n",
      "watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\n",
      "to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\n",
      "to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\n",
      "speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\n",
      "of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\n",
      "was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\n",
      "complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\n",
      "oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\n",
      "least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\n",
      "arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\n",
      "ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\n",
      "it ran away when it saw mine coming!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\n",
      "that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",
      "“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\n",
      "looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\n",
      "introduce it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\n",
      "kiss my hand if it likes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\n",
      "that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\n",
      "but I don’t remember where.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\n",
      "the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\n",
      "have this cat removed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\n",
      "small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\n",
      "hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\n",
      "on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\n",
      "passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\n",
      "of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\n",
      "whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\n",
      "to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\n",
      "other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\n",
      "the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\n",
      "helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\n",
      "was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\n",
      "matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\n",
      "of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\n",
      "escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\n",
      "a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\n",
      "the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\n",
      "while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\n",
      "the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\n",
      "all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\n",
      "what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\n",
      "there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\n",
      "thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\n",
      "less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\n",
      "this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\n",
      "anxious.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\n",
      "Duchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\n",
      "And the executioner went off like an arrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\n",
      "time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\n",
      "the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\n",
      "while the rest of the party went back to the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\n",
      "said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\n",
      "and they walked off together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\n",
      "to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\n",
      "savage when they met in the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\n",
      "tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\n",
      "does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\n",
      "hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\n",
      "kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\n",
      "them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\n",
      "sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\n",
      "so stingy about it, you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\n",
      "startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\n",
      "about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\n",
      "tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\n",
      "a bit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\n",
      "you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\n",
      "she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\n",
      "Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\n",
      "right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\n",
      "uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\n",
      "bore it as well as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\n",
      "the conversation a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\n",
      "’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\n",
      "their own business!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\n",
      "sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\n",
      "_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\n",
      "themselves.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\n",
      "the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\n",
      "the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\n",
      "to have the experiment tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\n",
      "the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\n",
      "putting things!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\n",
      "everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\n",
      "And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\n",
      "of yours.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\n",
      "remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\n",
      "is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\n",
      "simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\n",
      "appear to others that what you were or might have been was not\n",
      "otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\n",
      "otherwise.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\n",
      "“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\n",
      "in a pleased tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\n",
      "Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present\n",
      "of everything I’ve said as yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\n",
      "birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\n",
      "loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\n",
      "little chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\n",
      "feel a little worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\n",
      "the m—”\n",
      "\n",
      "But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\n",
      "even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\n",
      "linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\n",
      "Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\n",
      "thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\n",
      "ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\n",
      "about half no time! Take your choice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\n",
      "much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\n",
      "croquet-ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\n",
      "resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\n",
      "back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\n",
      "would cost them their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\n",
      "with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\n",
      "her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\n",
      "soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\n",
      "that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\n",
      "all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\n",
      "and under sentence of execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\n",
      "you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\n",
      "to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\n",
      "good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\n",
      "number of executions the Queen had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\n",
      "you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\n",
      "thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\n",
      "executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\n",
      "with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\n",
      "but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\n",
      "as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\n",
      "she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,\n",
      "half to itself, half to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\n",
      "executes nobody, you know. Come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\n",
      "after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\n",
      "sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\n",
      "nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\n",
      "pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\n",
      "Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\n",
      "his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\n",
      "history, she do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\n",
      "down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\n",
      "But she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\n",
      "Turtle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\n",
      "heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\n",
      "saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\n",
      "help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\n",
      "sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\n",
      "angrily: “really you are very dull!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\n",
      "question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\n",
      "at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\n",
      "Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\n",
      "day about it!” and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\n",
      "The Mock Turtle went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\n",
      "proud as all that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\n",
      "tone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n",
      "‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\n",
      "of the sea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\n",
      "only took the regular course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that?” inquired Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\n",
      "replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\n",
      "Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of\n",
      "uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\n",
      "is, you _are_ a simpleton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\n",
      "she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\n",
      "subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\n",
      "Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\n",
      "that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\n",
      "Fainting in Coils.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\n",
      "stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\n",
      "though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\n",
      "Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\n",
      "creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\n",
      "to change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\n",
      "“because they lessen from day to day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\n",
      "before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\n",
      "a holiday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\n",
      "decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\n",
      "his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\n",
      "two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\n",
      "said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\n",
      "the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\n",
      "running down his cheeks, he went on again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\n",
      "Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\n",
      "(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\n",
      "said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\n",
      "Lobster Quadrille is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\n",
      "sea-shore—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\n",
      "then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—you advance twice—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—as far out to sea as you can—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\n",
      "been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\n",
      "sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\n",
      "Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\n",
      "then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\n",
      "forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\n",
      "and sadly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\n",
      "“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\n",
      "See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\n",
      "They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\n",
      "When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\n",
      "But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\n",
      "Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\n",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\n",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\n",
      "“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\n",
      "The further off from England the nearer is to France—\n",
      "Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\n",
      "feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\n",
      "curious song about the whiting!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\n",
      "of course?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\n",
      "hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\n",
      "seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\n",
      "their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\n",
      "all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\n",
      "and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\n",
      "eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\n",
      "lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\n",
      "fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\n",
      "couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\n",
      "about a whiting before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\n",
      "know why it’s called a whiting?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\n",
      "in a wondering tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\n",
      "makes them so shiny?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\n",
      "answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n",
      "“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n",
      "“any shrimp could have told you that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\n",
      "running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\n",
      "please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\n",
      "wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\n",
      "and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\n",
      "the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\n",
      "Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\n",
      "because I was a different person then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n",
      "“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\n",
      "saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\n",
      "the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\n",
      "their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\n",
      "went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\n",
      "about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\n",
      "Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\n",
      "Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\n",
      "should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\n",
      "begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\n",
      "authority over Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the\n",
      "Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\n",
      "thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\n",
      "up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\n",
      "Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\n",
      "very queer indeed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n",
      "“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\n",
      "As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\n",
      "Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "[later editions continued as follows\n",
      "When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\n",
      "And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\n",
      "But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\n",
      "His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\n",
      "the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\n",
      "uncommon nonsense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\n",
      "wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next\n",
      "verse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn\n",
      "them out with his nose, you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\n",
      "puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\n",
      "begins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\n",
      "wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\n",
      "How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”\n",
      "\n",
      "[later editions continued as follows\n",
      "The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\n",
      "While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\n",
      "When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\n",
      "Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\n",
      "While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\n",
      "And concluded the banquet—]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle\n",
      "interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the\n",
      "most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was\n",
      "only too glad to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon\n",
      "went on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice\n",

      "“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old\n",
      "fellow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\n",
      "with sobs, to sing this:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\n",
      "Waiting in a hot tureen!\n",
      "Who for such dainties would not stoop?\n",
      "Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n",
      "Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n",

      "\n",
      "“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\n",
      "to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the\n",
      "distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\n",
      "off, without waiting for the end of the song.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\n",

      "birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\n",
      "standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\n",
      "him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\n",
      "hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\n",
      "court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\n",
      "good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\n",
      "get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\n",
      "But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\n",
      "everything about her, to pass away the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\n",
      "about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n",
      "the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to\n",
      "herself, “because of his great wig.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\n",
      "wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\n",
      "did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\n",
      "(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\n",
      "animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\n",
      "said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\n",
      "proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\n",
      "girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\n",
      "would have done just as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\n",

      "to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n",
      "“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\n",
      "stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\n",
      "court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\n",
      "to make out who was talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\n",
      "that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\n",

      "“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\n",
      "muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\n",
      "could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\n",
      "very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\n",
      "that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\n",
      "at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\n",
      "was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\n",
      "was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\n",

      "deal to come before that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\n",
      "three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\n",
      "and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your\n",
      "Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\n",
      "my tea when I was sent for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”\n",

      "\n",
      "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\n",
      "from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\n",
      "confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\n",
      "bread-and-butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\n",
      "her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\n",
      "grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\n",
      "the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\n",
      "as long as there was room for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\n",
      "next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",

      "too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\n",
      "that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\n",
      "to the other side of the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",
      "of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\n",
      "on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\n",
      "executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n",
      "“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\n",
      "bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you\n",
      "take me for a dunce? Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\n",
      "that—only the March Hare said—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did!” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\n",
      "anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\n",
      "nothing, being fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\n",
      "down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\n",

      "“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\n",
      "the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\n",
      "explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\n",
      "up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\n",
      "head first, and then sat upon it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in\n",
      "the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\n",
      "applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\n",
      "court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\n",
      "King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get\n",
      "on better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\n",
      "the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\n",
      "without even waiting to put his shoes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\n",
      "officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\n",
      "to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call the next witness!” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\n",
      "her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\n",
      "court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give your evidence,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shan’t,” said the cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n",
      "“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\n",
      "after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\n",
      "nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!\n",
      "Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\n",
      "whiskers!”\n",
      "\n",
      "For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\n",
      "turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\n",
      "disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\n",
      "next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my\n",
      "dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\n",
      "forehead ache!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\n",
      "very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\n",
      "haven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her\n",
      "surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\n",
      "little voice, the name “Alice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\n",
      "large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\n",
      "a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\n",
      "upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\n",
      "they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\n",
      "goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\n",
      "began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\n",
      "of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\n",
      "idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\n",
      "jury-box, or they would die.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\n",
      "all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\n",
      "with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\n",
      "the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\n",
      "tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\n",
      "got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\n",
      "said to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\n",
      "trial one way up as the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\n",
      "upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\n",
      "them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\n",
      "accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\n",
      "anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\n",
      "court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\n",
      "just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\n",
      "Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\n",
      "said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\n",
      "he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\n",
      "to himself in an undertone,\n",
      "\n",
      "“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\n",
      "which word sounded best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\n",
      "Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n",
      "“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\n",
      "his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\n",
      "Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\n",
      "regular rule: you invented it just now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your\n",
      "verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\n",
      "White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been\n",
      "picked up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s in it?” said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\n",
      "letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\n",
      "nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\n",
      "nothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\n",
      "and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\n",
      "thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\n",
      "all brightened up again.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\n",
      "can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\n",
      "worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\n",
      "your name like an honest man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\n",
      "clever thing the King had said that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",

      "them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n",

      "\n",
      "“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\n",
      "verses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\n",

      "again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\n",
      "think?” he said to the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\n",

      "\n",
      "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\n",

      "tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\n",
      "head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\n",

      "Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\n",
      "had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\n",
      "dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\n",

      "what a wonderful dream it had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\n",
      "hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\n",
      "her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\n",
      "and this was her dream:—\n",
      "\n",
      "First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\n",
      "hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\n",
      "looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\n",
      "see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\n",
      "that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\n",
      "seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\n",
      "strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\n",
      "frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\n",

      "How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were\n",

      "was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\n",
      "assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\n",
      "sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully\n",
      "cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\n",
      "man of business on the very day of the funeral,\n",
      "and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to\n",
      "the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley\n",
      "was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or\n",
      "nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going\n",
      "to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that\n",
      "Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there\n",
      "would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\n",
      "stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\n",
      "than there would be in any other middle-aged\n",
      "gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\n",
      "spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--\n",
      "literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\n",

      "Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\n",
      "There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\n",
      "door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as\n",
      "Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the\n",
      "business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,\n",
      "but he answered to both names. It was all the\n",
      "same to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\n",
      "Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\n",
      "clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,\n",
      "from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\n",
      "secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The\n",
      "cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\n",
      "nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\n",
      "eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\n",
      "grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his\n",
      "eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low\n",
      "temperature always about with him; he iced his office in\n",
      "the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "External heat and cold had little influence on\n",
      "Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather\n",
      "chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,\n",
      "no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\n",
      "pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't\n",
      "know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and\n",
      "snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\n",
      "over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"\n",
      "handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\n",
      "gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\n",
      "When will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored\n",
      "him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\n",
      "what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\n",
      "his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\n",
      "Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\n",
      "know him; and when they saw him coming on, would\n",
      "tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\n",
      "then would wag their tails as though they said, \"No\n",
      "eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\n",

      "of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\n",
      "was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\n",
      "on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his\n",
      "counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\n",
      "withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\n",
      "go wheezing up and down, beating their hands\n",
      "upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\n",
      "pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had\n",
      "only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\n",
      "it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\n",
      "in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\n",
      "ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog\n",
      "came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\n",
      "so dense without, that although the court was of the\n",
      "narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\n",
      "To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\n",
      "everything, one might have thought that Nature\n",
      "lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open\n",
      "that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\n",
      "dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\n",
      "letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\n",
      "fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\n",
      "coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept\n",
      "the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\n",
      "clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\n",
      "that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore\n",
      "the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to\n",
      "warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being\n",
      "a man of a strong imagination, he failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried\n",
      "a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was\n",
      "the first intimation he had of his approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the\n",
      "fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was\n",
      "all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his\n",
      "eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew. \"You don't mean that, I am sure?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What\n",
      "right have you to be merry? What reason have you\n",
      "to be merry? You're poor enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What\n",
      "right have you to be dismal? What reason have you\n",
      "to be morose? You're rich enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur\n",
      "of the moment, said, \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up\n",
      "with \"Humbug.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I\n",
      "live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!\n",
      "Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas\n",
      "time to you but a time for paying bills without\n",
      "money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but\n",
      "not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books\n",
      "and having every item in 'em through a round dozen\n",
      "of months presented dead against you? If I could\n",
      "work my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot\n",
      "who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,\n",
      "should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried\n",
      "with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas\n",
      "in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew. \"But you\n",
      "don't keep it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much\n",
      "good may it do you! Much good it has ever done\n",
      "you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are many things from which I might have\n",
      "derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare\n",
      "say,\" returned the nephew. \"Christmas among the\n",
      "rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas\n",
      "time, when it has come round--apart from the\n",
      "veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything\n",
      "belonging to it can be apart from that--as a\n",
      "good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant\n",
      "time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar\n",
      "of the year, when men and women seem by one consent\n",
      "to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think\n",
      "of people below them as if they really were\n",
      "fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race\n",
      "of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\n",
      "uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or\n",
      "silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me\n",
      "good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.\n",
      "Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,\n",
      "he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark\n",
      "for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me hear another sound from you,\" said\n",
      "Scrooge, \"and you'll keep your Christmas by losing\n",
      "your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker,\n",
      "sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you\n",
      "don't go into Parliament.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he\n",
      "did. He went the whole length of the expression,\n",
      "and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I fell in love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if\n",
      "that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous\n",
      "than a merry Christmas. \"Good afternoon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before\n",
      "that happened. Why give it as a reason for not\n",
      "coming now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;\n",
      "why cannot we be friends?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so\n",
      "resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I\n",
      "have been a party. But I have made the trial in\n",
      "homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas\n",
      "humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And A Happy New Year!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "His nephew left the room without an angry word,\n",
      "notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to\n",
      "bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,\n",
      "cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\n",
      "them cordially.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who\n",
      "overheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a\n",
      "week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry\n",
      "Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had\n",
      "let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,\n",
      "pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,\n",
      "in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in\n",
      "their hands, and bowed to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the\n",
      "gentlemen, referring to his list. \"Have I the pleasure\n",
      "of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\"\n",
      "Scrooge replied. \"He died seven years ago, this very\n",
      "night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented\n",
      "by his surviving partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting\n",
      "his credentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "It certainly was; for they had been two kindred\n",
      "spirits. At the ominous word \"liberality,\" Scrooge\n",
      "frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\"\n",
      "said the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than\n",
      "usually desirable that we should make some slight\n",
      "provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer\n",
      "greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in\n",
      "want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands\n",
      "are in want of common comforts, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down\n",
      "the pen again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge.\n",
      "\"Are they still in operation?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish\n",
      "I could say they were not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,\n",
      "then?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Both very busy, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,\n",
      "that something had occurred to stop them in their\n",
      "useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I'm very glad to\n",
      "hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish\n",
      "Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,\"\n",
      "returned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring\n",
      "to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,\n",
      "and means of warmth. We choose this time, because\n",
      "it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,\n",
      "and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down\n",
      "for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You wish to be anonymous?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you\n",
      "ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.\n",
      "I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't\n",
      "afford to make idle people merry. I help to support\n",
      "the establishments I have mentioned--they cost\n",
      "enough; and those who are badly off must go there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had\n",
      "better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\n",
      "Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It's\n",
      "enough for a man to understand his own business, and\n",
      "not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies\n",
      "me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue\n",
      "their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed\n",
      "his labours with an improved opinion of himself,\n",
      "and in a more facetious temper than was usual\n",
      "with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that\n",
      "people ran about with flaring links, proffering their\n",
      "services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct\n",
      "them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\n",
      "whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down\n",
      "at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became\n",
      "invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the\n",
      "clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if\n",
      "its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\n",
      "The cold became intense. In the main street, at the\n",
      "corner of the court, some labourers were repairing\n",
      "the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\n",
      "round which a party of ragged men and boys were\n",
      "gathered: warming their hands and winking their\n",
      "eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\n",
      "being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,\n",
      "and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness\n",

      "crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale\n",
      "faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'\n",
      "trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,\n",
      "with which it was next to impossible to believe that\n",
      "such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything\n",
      "to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the\n",
      "mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks\n",
      "and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's\n",
      "household should; and even the little tailor, whom he\n",
      "had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for\n",
      "being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up\n",
      "to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean\n",
      "wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting\n",
      "cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped\n",
      "the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather\n",
      "as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then\n",
      "indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The\n",
      "owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled\n",
      "by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\n",
      "stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with\n",
      "a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"God bless you, merry gentleman!\n",
      "         May nothing you dismay!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,\n",
      "that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to\n",
      "the fog and even more congenial frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house\n",
      "arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his\n",
      "stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant\n",
      "clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,\n",
      "and put on his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said\n",
      "Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If quite convenient, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not\n",
      "fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd\n",
      "think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk smiled faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think me ill-used,\n",
      "when I pay a day's wages for no work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every\n",
      "twenty-fifth of December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning\n",
      "his great-coat to the chin. \"But I suppose you must\n",
      "have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\n",
      "morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge\n",
      "walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a\n",
      "twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his\n",
      "white comforter dangling below his waist (for he\n",
      "boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,\n",
      "at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in\n",
      "honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home\n",
      "to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play\n",
      "at blindman's-buff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual\n",
      "melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and\n",
      "beguiled the rest of the evening with his\n",
      "banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in\n",
      "chambers which had once belonged to his deceased\n",
      "partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a\n",
      "lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so\n",
      "little business to be, that one could scarcely help\n",
      "fancying it must have run there when it was a young\n",
      "house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,\n",
      "and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough\n",
      "now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but\n",
      "Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\n",
      "The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew\n",
      "its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.\n",
      "The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway\n",
      "of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of\n",
      "the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\n",
      "threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all\n",
      "particular about the knocker on the door, except that it\n",
      "was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had\n",
      "seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\n",
      "in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what\n",
      "is called fancy about him as any man in the city of\n",
      "London, even including--which is a bold word--the\n",
      "corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be\n",
      "borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one\n",
      "thought on Marley, since his last mention of his\n",
      "seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then\n",
      "let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened\n",
      "that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,\n",
      "saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate\n",
      "process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow\n",
      "as the other objects in the yard were, but had a\n",
      "dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark\n",
      "cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked\n",
      "at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly\n",
      "spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The\n",
      "hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\n",
      "and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly\n",
      "motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it\n",
      "horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the\n",
      "face and beyond its control, rather than a part of\n",
      "its own expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it\n",
      "was a knocker again.\n",
      "\n",
      "To say that he was not startled, or that his blood\n",
      "was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it\n",
      "had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.\n",
      "But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,\n",
      "turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before\n",
      "he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind\n",
      "it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the\n",
      "sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall.\n",
      "But there was nothing on the back of the door, except\n",
      "the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he\n",
      "said \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed it with a bang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound resounded through the house like thunder.\n",
      "Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's\n",
      "cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal\n",
      "of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to\n",
      "be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and\n",
      "walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:\n",
      "trimming his candle as he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six\n",
      "up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad\n",
      "young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you\n",
      "might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken\n",
      "it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall\n",
      "and the door towards the balustrades: and done it\n",
      "easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room\n",
      "to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge\n",
      "thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before\n",
      "him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of\n",
      "the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,\n",
      "so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with\n",
      "Scrooge's dip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.\n",
      "Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before\n",
      "he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms\n",
      "to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection\n",
      "of the face to desire to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they\n",
      "should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under\n",
      "the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin\n",
      "ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had\n",
      "a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the\n",
      "bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,\n",
      "which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\n",
      "against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,\n",
      "old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three\n",
      "legs, and a poker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked\n",
      "himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his\n",
      "custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off\n",
      "his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and\n",
      "his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take\n",
      "his gruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a\n",
      "bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and\n",
      "brood over it, before he could extract the least\n",
      "sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.\n",
      "The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch\n",
      "merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint\n",
      "Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\n",
      "There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;\n",
      "Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending\n",
      "through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,\n",
      "Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,\n",
      "hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;\n",
      "and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came\n",
      "like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the\n",
      "whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,\n",
      "with power to shape some picture on its surface from\n",
      "the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would\n",
      "have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Humbug!\" said Scrooge; and walked across the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several turns, he sat down again. As he\n",
      "threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened\n",
      "to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the\n",
      "room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten\n",
      "with a chamber in the highest story of the\n",
      "building. It was with great astonishment, and with\n",
      "a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he\n",
      "saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in\n",
      "the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it\n",
      "rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,\n",
      "but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had\n",
      "begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking\n",
      "noise, deep down below; as if some person were\n",
      "dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the\n",
      "wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have\n",
      "heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\n",
      "dragging chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,\n",
      "and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors\n",
      "below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight\n",
      "towards his door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won't believe it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His colour changed though, when, without a pause,\n",
      "it came on through the heavy door, and passed into\n",
      "the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the\n",
      "dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know\n",
      "him; Marley's Ghost!\" and fell again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,\n",
      "usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on\n",
      "the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,\n",
      "and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was\n",
      "clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound\n",
      "about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge\n",
      "observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,\n",
      "ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.\n",
      "His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,\n",
      "and looking through his waistcoat, could see\n",
      "the two buttons on his coat behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no\n",
      "bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he\n",
      "looked the phantom through and through, and saw\n",
      "it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\n",
      "influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very\n",
      "texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head\n",
      "and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;\n",
      "he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.\n",
      "\"What do you want with me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much!\"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ask me who I was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who were you then?\" said Scrooge, raising his\n",
      "voice. \"You're particular, for a shade.\" He was going\n",
      "to say \"to a shade,\" but substituted this, as more\n",
      "appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking\n",
      "doubtfully at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do it, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know\n",
      "whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in\n",
      "a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event\n",
      "of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity\n",
      "of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat\n",
      "down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he\n",
      "were quite used to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of\n",
      "your senses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you doubt your senses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them.\n",
      "A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may\n",
      "be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of\n",
      "cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of\n",
      "gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking\n",
      "jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means\n",
      "waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\n",
      "smart, as a means of distracting his own attention,\n",
      "and keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice\n",
      "disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence\n",
      "for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very\n",
      "deuce with him. There was something very awful,\n",
      "too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\n",
      "atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it\n",
      "himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the\n",
      "Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts,\n",
      "and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour\n",
      "from an oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning\n",
      "quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned;\n",
      "and wishing, though it were only for a second, to\n",
      "divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" replied the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" returned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow\n",
      "this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a\n",
      "legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug,\n",
      "I tell you! humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook\n",
      "its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that\n",
      "Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself\n",
      "from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was\n",
      "his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage\n",
      "round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,\n",
      "its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands\n",
      "before his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy!\" he said. \"Dreadful apparition, why do\n",
      "you trouble me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do\n",
      "you believe in me or not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits\n",
      "walk the earth, and why do they come to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned,\n",
      "\"that the spirit within him should walk abroad among\n",
      "his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that\n",
      "spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so\n",
      "after death. It is doomed to wander through the\n",
      "world--oh, woe is me!--and witness what it cannot\n",
      "share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to\n",
      "happiness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain\n",
      "and wrung its shadowy hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell\n",
      "me why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost.\n",
      "\"I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded\n",
      "it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I\n",
      "wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge trembled more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the\n",
      "weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?\n",
      "It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven\n",
      "Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since.\n",
      "It is a ponderous chain!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the\n",
      "expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty\n",
      "or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jacob,\" he said, imploringly. \"Old Jacob Marley,\n",
      "tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have none to give,\" the Ghost replied. \"It comes\n",
      "from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed\n",
      "by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor\n",
      "can I tell you what I would. A very little more is\n",
      "all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I\n",
      "cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked\n",
      "beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my\n",
      "spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our\n",
      "money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before\n",
      "me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became\n",
      "thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.\n",
      "Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now,\n",
      "but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his\n",
      "knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\"\n",
      "Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though\n",
      "with humility and deference.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Slow!\" the Ghost repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seven years dead,\" mused Scrooge. \"And travelling\n",
      "all the time!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The whole time,\" said the Ghost. \"No rest, no\n",
      "peace. Incessant torture of remorse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You travel fast?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the wings of the wind,\" replied the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You might have got over a great quantity of\n",
      "ground in seven years,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and\n",
      "clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of\n",
      "the night, that the Ward would have been justified in\n",
      "indicting it for a nuisance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,\" cried the\n",
      "phantom, \"not to know, that ages of incessant labour\n",
      "by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into\n",
      "eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\n",
      "all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit\n",
      "working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may\n",
      "be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast\n",
      "means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of\n",
      "regret can make amends for one life's opportunity\n",
      "misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you were always a good man of business,\n",
      "Jacob,\" faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this\n",
      "to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Business!\" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands\n",
      "again. \"Mankind was my business. The common\n",
      "welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,\n",
      "and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings\n",
      "of my trade were but a drop of water in the\n",
      "comprehensive ocean of my business!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were\n",
      "the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it\n",
      "heavily upon the ground again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this time of the rolling year,\" the spectre said,\n",
      "\"I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of\n",
      "fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never\n",
      "raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise\n",
      "Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to\n",
      "which its light would have conducted me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the\n",
      "spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake\n",
      "exceedingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hear me!\" cried the Ghost. \"My time is nearly\n",
      "gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will,\" said Scrooge. \"But don't be hard upon\n",
      "me! Don't be flowery, Jacob! Pray!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that\n",
      "you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible\n",
      "beside you many and many a day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered,\n",
      "and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is no light part of my penance,\" pursued\n",
      "the Ghost. \"I am here to-night to warn you, that you\n",
      "have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A\n",
      "chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were always a good friend to me,\" said\n",
      "Scrooge. \"Thank'ee!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will be haunted,\" resumed the Ghost, \"by\n",
      "Three Spirits.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the\n",
      "Ghost's had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned,\n",
      "Jacob?\" he demanded, in a faltering voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--I think I'd rather not,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Without their visits,\" said the Ghost, \"you cannot\n",
      "hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow,\n",
      "when the bell tolls One.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over,\n",
      "Jacob?\" hinted Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Expect the second on the next night at the same\n",
      "hour. The third upon the next night when the last\n",
      "stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see\n",
      "me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you\n",
      "remember what has passed between us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When it had said these words, the spectre took its\n",
      "wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head,\n",
      "as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its\n",
      "teeth made, when the jaws were brought together\n",
      "by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again,\n",
      "and found his supernatural visitor confronting him\n",
      "in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and\n",
      "about its arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apparition walked backward from him; and at\n",
      "every step it took, the window raised itself a little,\n",
      "so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.\n",
      "When they were within two paces of each other,\n",
      "Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to\n",
      "come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:\n",
      "for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible\n",
      "of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of\n",
      "lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\n",
      "self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment,\n",
      "joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the\n",
      "bleak, dark night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his\n",
      "curiosity. He looked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither\n",
      "and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they\n",
      "went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's\n",
      "Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)\n",
      "were linked together; none were free. Many had\n",
      "been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He\n",
      "had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white\n",
      "waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to\n",
      "its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist\n",
      "a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,\n",
      "upon a door-step. The misery with them all was,\n",
      "clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in\n",
      "human matters, and had lost the power for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist\n",
      "enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and\n",
      "their spirit voices faded together; and the night became\n",
      "as it had been when he walked home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door\n",
      "by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked,\n",
      "as he had locked it with his own hands, and\n",
      "the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\"\n",
      "but stopped at the first syllable. And being,\n",
      "from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues\n",
      "of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or\n",
      "the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of\n",
      "the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to\n",
      "bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the\n",
      "instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,\n",
      "he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from\n",
      "the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to\n",
      "pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a\n",
      "neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened\n",
      "for the hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from\n",
      "six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to\n",
      "twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he\n",
      "went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have\n",
      "got into the works. Twelve!\n",
      "\n",
      "He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most\n",
      "preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:\n",
      "and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have\n",
      "slept through a whole day and far into another night. It\n",
      "isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and\n",
      "this is twelve at noon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,\n",
      "and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub\n",
      "the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he\n",
      "could see anything; and could see very little then. All he\n",
      "could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely\n",
      "cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,\n",
      "and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been\n",
      "if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the\n",
      "world.  This was a great relief, because \"three days after sight\n",
      "of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his\n",
      "order,\" and so forth, would have become a mere United States'\n",
      "security if there were no days to count by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought\n",
      "it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he\n",
      "thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured\n",
      "not to think, the more he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved\n",
      "within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his\n",
      "mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first\n",
      "position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through,\n",
      "\"Was it a dream or not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters\n",
      "more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned\n",
      "him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie\n",
      "awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could\n",
      "no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the\n",
      "wisest resolution in his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he\n",
      "must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock.\n",
      "At length it broke upon his listening ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ding, dong!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A quarter past,\" said Scrooge, counting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ding, dong!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Half-past!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ding, dong!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A quarter to it,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ding, dong!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge, triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a\n",
      "deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.  Light flashed up in the room\n",
      "upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a\n",
      "hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his\n",
      "back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains\n",
      "of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a\n",
      "half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the\n",
      "unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now\n",
      "to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a\n",
      "child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural\n",
      "medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded\n",
      "from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.\n",
      "Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was\n",
      "white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\n",
      "it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were\n",
      "very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold\n",
      "were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately\n",
      "formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic\n",
      "of the purest white; and round its waist was bound\n",
      "a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held\n",
      "a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular\n",
      "contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed\n",
      "with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,\n",
      "that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear\n",
      "jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was\n",
      "doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\n",
      "great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing\n",
      "steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt\n",
      "sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,\n",
      "and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so\n",
      "the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a\n",
      "thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,\n",
      "now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a\n",
      "body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible\n",
      "in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the\n",
      "very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and\n",
      "clear as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to\n",
      "me?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if\n",
      "instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who, and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Long Past?\" inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish\n",
      "stature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Your past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if\n",
      "anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire\n",
      "to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out,\n",
      "with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough\n",
      "that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and\n",
      "force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon\n",
      "my brow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend\n",
      "or any knowledge of having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at\n",
      "any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what\n",
      "business brought him there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not\n",
      "help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been\n",
      "more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard\n",
      "him thinking, for it said immediately:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him\n",
      "gently by the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rise! and walk with me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the\n",
      "weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;\n",
      "that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below\n",
      "freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,\n",
      "dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at\n",
      "that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand,\n",
      "was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit\n",
      "made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bear but a touch of my hand there,\" said the Spirit,\n",
      "laying it upon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more\n",
      "than this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,\n",
      "and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either\n",
      "hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it\n",
      "was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished\n",
      "with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon\n",
      "the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,\n",
      "as he looked about him. \"I was bred in this place. I was\n",
      "a boy here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,\n",
      "though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still\n",
      "present to the old man's sense of feeling. He was conscious\n",
      "of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected\n",
      "with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares\n",
      "long, long, forgotten!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is\n",
      "that upon your cheek?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,\n",
      "that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him\n",
      "where he would.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could\n",
      "walk it blindfold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed\n",
      "the Ghost. \"Let us go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every\n",
      "gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared\n",
      "in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.\n",
      "Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them\n",
      "with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in\n",
      "country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys\n",
      "were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the\n",
      "broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air\n",
      "laughed to hear it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said\n",
      "the Ghost. \"They have no consciousness of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge\n",
      "knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond\n",
      "all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and\n",
      "his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled\n",
      "with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\n",
      "Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for\n",
      "their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?\n",
      "Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done\n",
      "to him?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A\n",
      "solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and\n",
      "soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little\n",
      "weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell\n",
      "hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken\n",
      "fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\n",
      "were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their\n",
      "gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;\n",
      "and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.\n",
      "Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for\n",
      "entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open\n",
      "doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,\n",
      "cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a\n",
      "chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow\n",
      "with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too\n",
      "much to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a\n",
      "door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and\n",
      "disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by\n",
      "lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely\n",
      "boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down\n",
      "upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he\n",
      "used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle\n",
      "from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the\n",
      "half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among\n",
      "the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle\n",
      "swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in\n",
      "the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening\n",
      "influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his\n",
      "younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in\n",
      "foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:\n",
      "stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and\n",
      "leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It's\n",
      "dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas\n",
      "time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,\n",
      "he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And\n",
      "Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his wild brother, Orson; there\n",
      "they go! And what's his name, who was put down in his\n",
      "drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see him!\n",
      "And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii;\n",
      "there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I'm glad of it.\n",
      "What business had he to be married to the Princess!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature\n",
      "on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between\n",
      "laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited\n",
      "face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in\n",
      "the city, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and\n",
      "yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the\n",
      "top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called\n",
      "him, when he came home again after sailing round the\n",
      "island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\n",
      "Crusoe?'  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't.\n",
      "It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running\n",
      "for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his\n",
      "usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor\n",
      "boy!\" and cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his\n",
      "pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his\n",
      "cuff: \"but it's too late now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy\n",
      "singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should\n",
      "like to have given him something: that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:\n",
      "saying as it did so, \"Let us see another Christmas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the\n",
      "room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk,\n",
      "the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the\n",
      "ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how\n",
      "all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you\n",
      "do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything\n",
      "had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all\n",
      "the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.\n",
      "Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of\n",
      "his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,\n",
      "came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and\n",
      "often kissing him, addressed him as her \"Dear, dear\n",
      "brother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the\n",
      "child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.\n",
      "\"To bring you home, home, home!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home, for good\n",
      "and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder\n",
      "than he used to be, that home's like Heaven! He spoke so\n",
      "gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that\n",
      "I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come\n",
      "home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach\n",
      "to bring you. And you're to be a man!\" said the child,\n",
      "opening her eyes, \"and are never to come back here; but\n",
      "first, we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have\n",
      "the merriest time in all the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his\n",
      "head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on\n",
      "tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her\n",
      "childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to\n",
      "go, accompanied her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master\n",
      "Scrooge's box, there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster\n",
      "himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious\n",
      "condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind\n",
      "by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his\n",
      "sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that\n",
      "ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial\n",
      "and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.\n",
      "Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a\n",
      "block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments\n",
      "of those dainties to the young people: at the same time,\n",
      "sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of \"something\"\n",
      "to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\n",
      "but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had\n",
      "rather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied\n",
      "on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster\n",
      "good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove\n",
      "gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the\n",
      "hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens\n",
      "like spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have\n",
      "withered,\" said the Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You're right. I will not\n",
      "gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think,\n",
      "children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One child,\" Scrooge returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly,\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although they had but that moment left the school behind\n",
      "them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city,\n",
      "where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy\n",
      "carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and\n",
      "tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by\n",
      "the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas\n",
      "time again; but it was evening, and the streets were\n",
      "lighted up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked\n",
      "Scrooge if he knew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh\n",
      "wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two\n",
      "inches taller he must have knocked his head against the\n",
      "ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig\n",
      "alive again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the\n",
      "clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his\n",
      "hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over\n",
      "himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and\n",
      "called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly\n",
      "in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost.\n",
      "\"Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached\n",
      "to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night.\n",
      "Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's\n",
      "have the shutters up,\" cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap\n",
      "of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack Robinson!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it!\n",
      "They charged into the street with the shutters--one, two,\n",
      "three--had 'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred\n",
      "'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back\n",
      "before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the\n",
      "high desk, with wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads,\n",
      "and let's have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup,\n",
      "Ebenezer!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared\n",
      "away, or couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking\n",
      "on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if\n",
      "it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was\n",
      "swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon\n",
      "the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and\n",
      "bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter's\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the\n",
      "lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty\n",
      "stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial\n",
      "smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and\n",
      "lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they\n",
      "broke. In came all the young men and women employed in\n",
      "the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the\n",
      "baker. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend,\n",
      "the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was\n",
      "suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying\n",
      "to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who\n",
      "was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.\n",
      "In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,\n",
      "some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;\n",
      "in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went,\n",
      "twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again\n",
      "the other way; down the middle and up again; round\n",
      "and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old\n",
      "top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top\n",
      "couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top\n",
      "couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When\n",
      "this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\n",
      "hands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well done!\" and the\n",
      "fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially\n",
      "provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his\n",
      "reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no\n",
      "dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home,\n",
      "exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\n",
      "resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more\n",
      "dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there\n",
      "was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece\n",
      "of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.\n",
      "But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast\n",
      "and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort\n",
      "of man who knew his business better than you or I could\n",
      "have told it him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\"  Then\n",
      "old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top\n",
      "couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them;\n",
      "three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were\n",
      "not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no\n",
      "notion of walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old\n",
      "Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would\n",
      "Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner\n",
      "in every sense of the term. If that's not high praise, tell me\n",
      "higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared to issue\n",
      "from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the\n",
      "dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given\n",
      "time, what would have become of them next. And when old\n",
      "Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;\n",
      "advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and\n",
      "curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to\n",
      "your place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly, that he appeared\n",
      "to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without\n",
      "a stagger.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side\n",
      "of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually\n",
      "as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.\n",
      "When everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did\n",
      "the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,\n",
      "and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a\n",
      "counter in the back-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a\n",
      "man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene,\n",
      "and with his former self. He corroborated everything,\n",
      "remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent\n",
      "the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the\n",
      "bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from\n",
      "them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious\n",
      "that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its\n",
      "head burnt very clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly\n",
      "folks so full of gratitude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,\n",
      "who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:\n",
      "and when he had done so, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of\n",
      "your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so\n",
      "much that he deserves this praise?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and\n",
      "speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.\n",
      "\"It isn't that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy\n",
      "or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a\n",
      "pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and\n",
      "looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is\n",
      "impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness\n",
      "he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Scrooge, \"No. I should like to be able to say\n",
      "a word or two to my clerk just now. That's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance\n",
      "to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by\n",
      "side in the open air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he\n",
      "could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again\n",
      "Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime\n",
      "of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later\n",
      "years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.\n",
      "There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which\n",
      "showed the passion that had taken root, and where the\n",
      "shadow of the growing tree would fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young\n",
      "girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears,\n",
      "which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of\n",
      "Christmas Past.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It matters little,\" she said, softly. \"To you, very little.\n",
      "Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort\n",
      "you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have\n",
      "no just cause to grieve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What Idol has displaced you?\" he rejoined.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A golden one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\" he said.\n",
      "\"There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and\n",
      "there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity\n",
      "as the pursuit of wealth!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You fear the world too much,\" she answered, gently.\n",
      "\"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being\n",
      "beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your\n",
      "nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion,\n",
      "Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What then?\" he retorted. \"Even if I have grown so\n",
      "much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were\n",
      "both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could\n",
      "improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You\n",
      "are changed. When it was made, you were another man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was a boy,\" he said impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you\n",
      "are,\" she returned. \"I am. That which promised happiness\n",
      "when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that\n",
      "we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of\n",
      "this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it,\n",
      "and can release you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have I ever sought release?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In words. No. Never.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In what, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another\n",
      "atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In\n",
      "everything that made my love of any worth or value in your\n",
      "sight. If this had never been between us,\" said the girl,\n",
      "looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; \"tell me,\n",
      "would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in\n",
      "spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, \"You think\n",
      "not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would gladly think otherwise if I could,\" she answered,\n",
      "\"Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this,\n",
      "I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you\n",
      "were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe\n",
      "that you would choose a dowerless girl--you who, in your\n",
      "very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or,\n",
      "choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your\n",
      "one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your\n",
      "repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I\n",
      "release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you\n",
      "once were.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was about to speak; but with her head turned from\n",
      "him, she resumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may--the memory of what is past half makes me\n",
      "hope you will--have pain in this. A very, very brief time,\n",
      "and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an\n",
      "unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you\n",
      "awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She left him, and they parted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, \"show me no more! Conduct\n",
      "me home. Why do you delight to torture me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One shadow more!\" exclaimed the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more!\" cried Scrooge. \"No more. I don't wish to\n",
      "see it. Show me no more!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms,\n",
      "and forced him to observe what happened next.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in another scene and place; a room, not very\n",
      "large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter\n",
      "fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge\n",
      "believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely\n",
      "matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this\n",
      "room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children\n",
      "there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\n",
      "and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not\n",
      "forty children conducting themselves like one, but every\n",
      "child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences\n",
      "were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;\n",
      "on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,\n",
      "and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\n",
      "mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands\n",
      "most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of\n",
      "them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I\n",
      "wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that\n",
      "braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little\n",
      "shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to\n",
      "save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they\n",
      "did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should\n",
      "have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,\n",
      "and never come straight again. And yet I should\n",
      "have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\n",
      "questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have\n",
      "looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never\n",
      "raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of\n",
      "which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should\n",
      "have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence\n",
      "of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its\n",
      "value.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a\n",
      "rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and\n",
      "plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed\n",
      "and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who\n",
      "came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys\n",
      "and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and\n",
      "the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!\n",
      "The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his\n",
      "pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight\n",
      "by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back,\n",
      "and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of\n",
      "wonder and delight with which the development of every\n",
      "package was received! The terrible announcement that the\n",
      "baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying-pan\n",
      "into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having\n",
      "swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!\n",
      "The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy,\n",
      "and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.\n",
      "It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions\n",
      "got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the\n",
      "top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever,\n",
      "when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning\n",
      "fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his\n",
      "own fireside; and when he thought that such another\n",
      "creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might\n",
      "have called him father, and been a spring-time in the\n",
      "haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Belle,\" said the husband, turning to his wife with a\n",
      "smile, \"I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who was it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Guess!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I? Tut, don't I know?\" she added in the\n",
      "same breath, laughing as he laughed. \"Mr. Scrooge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as\n",
      "it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could\n",
      "scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point\n",
      "of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in\n",
      "the world, I do believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge in a broken voice, \"remove me\n",
      "from this place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you these were shadows of the things that have\n",
      "been,\" said the Ghost. \"That they are what they are, do\n",
      "not blame me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remove me!\" Scrooge exclaimed, \"I cannot bear it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon\n",
      "him with a face, in which in some strange way there were\n",
      "fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which\n",
      "the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was\n",
      "undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed\n",
      "that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly\n",
      "connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the\n",
      "extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down\n",
      "upon its head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher\n",
      "covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down\n",
      "with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed\n",
      "from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an\n",
      "irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own\n",
      "bedroom.  He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand\n",
      "relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank\n",
      "into a heavy sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "AWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and\n",
      "sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had\n",
      "no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the\n",
      "stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness\n",
      "in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding\n",
      "a conference with the second messenger despatched to him\n",
      "through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he\n",
      "turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which\n",
      "of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put\n",
      "them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down\n",
      "again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For\n",
      "he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\n",
      "appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and\n",
      "made nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves\n",
      "on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually\n",
      "equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their\n",
      "capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for\n",
      "anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which\n",
      "opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and\n",
      "comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for\n",
      "Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you\n",
      "to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of\n",
      "strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and\n",
      "rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by\n",
      "any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the\n",
      "Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a\n",
      "violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter\n",
      "of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay\n",
      "upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy\n",
      "light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\n",
      "hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than\n",
      "a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it\n",
      "meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive\n",
      "that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of\n",
      "spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of\n",
      "knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you or\n",
      "I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not\n",
      "in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done\n",
      "in it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I\n",
      "say, he began to think that the source and secret of this\n",
      "ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence,\n",
      "on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking\n",
      "full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in\n",
      "his slippers to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange\n",
      "voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He\n",
      "obeyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his own room. There was no doubt about that.\n",
      "But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls\n",
      "and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a\n",
      "perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming\n",
      "berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and\n",
      "ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had\n",
      "been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring\n",
      "up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had\n",
      "never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and\n",
      "many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form\n",
      "a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,\n",
      "great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\n",
      "mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\n",
      "cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,\n",
      "immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that\n",
      "made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy\n",
      "state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to\n",
      "see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's\n",
      "horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge,\n",
      "as he came peeping round the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come in!\" exclaimed the Ghost. \"Come in! and know\n",
      "me better, man!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this\n",
      "Spirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and\n",
      "though the Spirit's eyes were clear and kind, he did not like\n",
      "to meet them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,\" said the Spirit.\n",
      "\"Look upon me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple\n",
      "green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment\n",
      "hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was\n",
      "bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any\n",
      "artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the\n",
      "garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other\n",
      "covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\n",
      "icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its\n",
      "genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,\n",
      "its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded\n",
      "round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword\n",
      "was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have never seen the like of me before!\" exclaimed\n",
      "the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never,\" Scrooge made answer to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have never walked forth with the younger members of\n",
      "my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers\n",
      "born in these later years?\" pursued the Phantom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think I have,\" said Scrooge. \"I am afraid I have\n",
      "not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More than eighteen hundred,\" said the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A tremendous family to provide for!\" muttered Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge submissively, \"conduct me where\n",
      "you will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt\n",
      "a lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught\n",
      "to teach me, let me profit by it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Touch my robe!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game,\n",
      "poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings,\n",
      "fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room,\n",
      "the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood\n",
      "in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the\n",
      "weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and\n",
      "not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the\n",
      "pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of\n",
      "their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see\n",
      "it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting\n",
      "into artificial little snow-storms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows\n",
      "blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow\n",
      "upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;\n",
      "which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by\n",
      "the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed\n",
      "and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great\n",
      "streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace\n",
      "in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,\n",
      "and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,\n",
      "half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended\n",
      "in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great\n",
      "Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away\n",
      "to their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very cheerful\n",
      "in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\n",
      "cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest\n",
      "summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops\n",
      "were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another\n",
      "from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious\n",
      "snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--\n",
      "laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it\n",
      "went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the\n",
      "fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,\n",
      "pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats\n",
      "of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out\n",
      "into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were\n",
      "ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in\n",
      "the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking\n",
      "from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went\n",
      "by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were\n",
      "pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there\n",
      "were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence\n",
      "to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might\n",
      "water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy\n",
      "and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among\n",
      "the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered\n",
      "leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting\n",
      "off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great\n",
      "compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and\n",
      "beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after\n",
      "dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among\n",
      "these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\n",
      "stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was\n",
      "something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and\n",
      "round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps\n",
      "two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such\n",
      "glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the\n",
      "counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller\n",
      "parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled\n",
      "up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\n",
      "scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even\n",
      "that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so\n",
      "extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,\n",
      "the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and\n",
      "spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on\n",
      "feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs\n",
      "were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in\n",
      "modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that\n",
      "everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but\n",
      "the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful\n",
      "promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other\n",
      "at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left\n",
      "their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to\n",
      "fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in\n",
      "the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people\n",
      "were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which\n",
      "they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,\n",
      "worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws\n",
      "to peck at if they chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and\n",
      "chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in\n",
      "their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the\n",
      "same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and\n",
      "nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners\n",
      "to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers\n",
      "appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with\n",
      "Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the\n",
      "covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their\n",
      "dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind\n",
      "of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words\n",
      "between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he\n",
      "shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good\n",
      "humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame\n",
      "to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love\n",

      "In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and\n",
      "yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners\n",
      "and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of\n",
      "wet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked as\n",
      "if its stones were cooking too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from\n",

      "\"There is. My own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To any kindly given. To a poor one most.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why to a poor one most?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it needs it most.\"\n",

      "desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent\n",
      "enjoyment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would deprive them of their means of dining every\n",
      "seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said\n",
      "to dine at all,\" said Scrooge. \"Wouldn't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?\" said\n",
      "Scrooge. \"And it comes to the same thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I seek!\" exclaimed the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your\n",
      "name, or at least in that of your family,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are some upon this earth of yours,\" returned the Spirit,\n",
      "\"who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion,\n",
      "pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness\n",
      "in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and\n",
      "kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge\n",
      "their doings on themselves, not us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on,\n",
      "invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the\n",
      "town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which\n",
      "Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding\n",
      "his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place\n",
      "with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\n",
      "gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible\n",
      "he could have done in any lofty hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in\n",
      "showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,\n",
      "generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor\n",
      "men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he\n",
      "went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and\n",
      "on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped\n",
      "to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his\n",
      "torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen \"Bob\" a-week\n",
      "himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his\n",
      "Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present\n",
      "blessed his four-roomed house!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out\n",
      "but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,\n",
      "which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and\n",
      "she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of\n",
      "her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter\n",
      "Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and\n",
      "getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private\n",
      "property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the\n",
      "day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly\n",
      "attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.\n",
      "And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing\n",
      "in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the\n",
      "goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious\n",
      "thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced\n",
      "about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the\n",
      "skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked\n",
      "him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,\n",
      "knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and\n",
      "peeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has ever got your precious father then?\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit. \"And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha\n",
      "warn't as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Martha, mother!\" said a girl, appearing as she\n",
      "spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Martha, mother!\" cried the two young Cratchits.\n",
      "\"Hurrah! There's such a goose, Martha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off\n",
      "her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,\" replied the\n",

      "a warm, Lord bless ye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no! There's father coming,\" cried the two young\n",
      "Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha,\n",
      "hide!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,\n",
      "with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,\n",
      "hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned\n",
      "up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his\n",
      "shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and\n",
      "had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, where's our Martha?\" cried Bob Cratchit, looking\n",
      "round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not coming!\" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his\n",
      "high spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way\n",
      "from church, and had come home rampant. \"Not coming\n",
      "upon Christmas Day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only\n",
      "in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet\n",
      "door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits\n",
      "hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,\n",
      "that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit,\n",
      "when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had\n",
      "hugged his daughter to his heart's content.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and better. Somehow he\n",
      "gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the\n",
      "strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home,\n",
      "that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he\n",
      "was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember\n",
      "upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind\n",
      "men see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and\n",
      "trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing\n",
      "strong and hearty.\n",
      "\n",
      "His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back\n",
      "came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by\n",
      "his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while\n",
      "Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were\n",
      "capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot\n",
      "mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round\n",
      "and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter,\n",
      "and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the\n",
      "goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose\n",
      "the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a\n",
      "black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was\n",
      "something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made\n",
      "the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;\n",
      "Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;\n",
      "Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted\n",
      "the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny\n",
      "corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for\n",
      "everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard\n",
      "upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\n",
      "they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be\n",
      "helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was\n",
      "said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared\n",
      "to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the\n",
      "long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\n",
      "delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,\n",
      "excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with\n",
      "the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\n",
      "\n",
      "There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe\n",
      "there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and\n",
      "flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal\n",
      "admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,\n",
      "it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\n",
      "atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at\n",
      "last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest\n",
      "Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to\n",
      "the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss\n",
      "Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to\n",
      "bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should\n",
      "break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got\n",
      "over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they\n",
      "were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two\n",
      "young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\n",
      "supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of\n",
      "the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the\n",
      "cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next\n",
      "door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!\n",
      "That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\n",
      "entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,\n",
      "like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half\n",
      "of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with\n",
      "Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly\n",
      "too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that\n",
      "now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had\n",
      "had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had\n",
      "something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\n",
      "was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have\n",
      "been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed\n",
      "to hint at such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the\n",
      "hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the\n",
      "jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges\n",
      "were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the\n",
      "fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in\n",
      "what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and\n",
      "at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\n",
      "Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as\n",
      "golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with\n",
      "beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and\n",
      "cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which all the family re-echoed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless us every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat very close to his father's side upon his little\n",
      "stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he\n",
      "loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and\n",
      "dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt\n",
      "before, \"tell me if Tiny Tim will live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor\n",
      "chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully\n",
      "preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future,\n",
      "the child will die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Scrooge. \"Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he\n",
      "will be spared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none\n",
      "other of my race,\" returned the Ghost, \"will find him here.\n",
      "What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and\n",
      "decrease the surplus population.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by\n",
      "the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man,\" said the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not\n",
      "adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered\n",
      "What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what\n",
      "men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the\n",
      "sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live\n",
      "than millions like this poor man's child. Oh God! to hear\n",
      "the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life\n",
      "among his hungry brothers in the dust!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast\n",
      "his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on\n",
      "hearing his own name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob; \"I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the\n",
      "Founder of the Feast!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Founder of the Feast indeed!\" cried Mrs. Cratchit,\n",
      "reddening. \"I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece\n",
      "of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good\n",
      "appetite for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children! Christmas Day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,\" said she, \"on\n",
      "which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,\n",
      "unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert!\n",
      "Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" was Bob's mild answer, \"Christmas Day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,\" said\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit, \"not for his. Long life to him! A merry\n",
      "Christmas and a happy new year! He'll be very merry and\n",
      "very happy, I have no doubt!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of\n",
      "their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank\n",
      "it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge\n",
      "was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast\n",
      "a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full\n",
      "five minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than\n",
      "before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done\n",
      "with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his\n",
      "eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full\n",
      "five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed\n",
      "tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business;\n",
      "and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\n",
      "between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\n",
      "investments he should favour when he came into the receipt\n",
      "of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor\n",
      "apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work\n",
      "she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,\n",
      "and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a\n",
      "good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at\n",
      "home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some\n",
      "days before, and how the lord \"was much about as tall as\n",
      "Peter;\" at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you\n",
      "couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this\n",
      "time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and\n",
      "by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in\n",
      "the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,\n",
      "and sang it very well indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not\n",
      "a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes\n",
      "were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;\n",
      "and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside\n",
      "of a pawnbroker's. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased\n",
      "with one another, and contented with the time; and when\n",
      "they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings\n",
      "of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon\n",
      "them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty\n",
      "heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets,\n",
      "the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and\n",
      "all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of\n",
      "the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot\n",
      "plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep\n",
      "red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\n",
      "There all the children of the house were running out\n",
      "into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins,\n",
      "uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,\n",
      "were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and\n",
      "there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,\n",
      "and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\n",
      "neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw\n",
      "them enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on\n",
      "their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought\n",
      "that no one was at home to give them welcome when they\n",
      "got there, instead of every house expecting company, and\n",
      "piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\n",
      "the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and\n",
      "opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with\n",
      "a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything\n",
      "within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before,\n",
      "dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was\n",
      "dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly\n",
      "as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter\n",
      "that he had any company but Christmas!\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they\n",
      "stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses\n",
      "of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place\n",
      "of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,\n",
      "or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;\n",
      "and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.\n",
      "Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\n",
      "red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a\n",
      "sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in\n",
      "the thick gloom of darkest night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What place is this?\" asked Scrooge.\n",

      "beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\n",
      "The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling\n",

      "the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;\n",
      "and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it\n",
      "rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it\n",
      "had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n",
      "\n",

      "one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and\n",

      "sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another\n",
      "on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared\n",
      "to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those\n",

      "abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it\n",

      "\"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that\n",

      "moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses\n",
      "pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts,\n",
      "either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I\n",
      "mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he\n",
      "likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas\n",
      "till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it--I defy\n",

      "Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much\n",
      "caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any\n",
      "rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the\n",
      "bottle joyously.\n",
      "\n",
      "After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical\n",
      "family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a\n",
      "Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who\n",
      "could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never\n",
      "swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face\n",
      "over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and\n",
      "played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:\n",
      "you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had\n",
      "been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the\n",
      "boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of\n",
      "Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the\n",
      "things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he\n",
      "softened more and more; and thought that if he could have\n",
      "listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the\n",
      "kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,\n",
      "without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\n",
      "Marley.\n",

      "a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children\n",
      "sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its\n",
      "mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first\n",
      "a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I\n",
      "no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he\n",
      "had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done\n",
      "thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the\n",
      "Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after\n",
      "that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the\n",
      "credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,\n",
      "tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,\n",
      "smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,\n",
      "there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.\n",
      "He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up\n",
      "against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would\n",
      "have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would\n",
      "have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly\n",
      "have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.\n",
      "She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.\n",
      "But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her\n",
      "silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got\n",
      "her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his\n",
      "conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to\n",
      "know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her\n",
      "head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by\n",
      "pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain\n",
      "about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told\n",
      "him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in\n",
      "office, they were so very confidential together, behind the\n",
      "curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party,\n",
      "but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,\n",
      "in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close\n",
      "behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her\n",
      "love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.\n",
      "Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was\n",
      "very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat\n",
      "her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper\n",
      "could have told you. There might have been twenty people there,\n",
      "young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for\n",
      "wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that\n",
      "his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with\n",
      "his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;\n",
      "for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut\n",
      "in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in\n",
      "his head to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,\n",
      "and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like\n",

      "this the Spirit said could not be done.\n",

      "It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew\n",
      "had to think of something, and the rest must find out what;\n",
      "he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case\n",
      "was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,\n",
      "elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live\n",
      "animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\n",
      "animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,\n",
      "and lived in London, and walked about the streets,\n",
      "and wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody, and\n",
      "didn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,\n",
      "and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a\n",
      "tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh\n",
      "question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a\n",
      "fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that\n",

      "Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal\n",

      "if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene\n",
      "passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\n",

      "\n",
      "Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they\n",

      "and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they\n",
      "were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was\n",
      "rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every\n",
      "refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not\n",

      "It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge\n",
      "had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared\n",
      "to be condensed into the space of time they passed\n",
      "together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained\n",
      "unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly\n",
      "older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of\n",
      "it, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when,\n",

      "touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled\n",

      "\n",
      "THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When\n",
      "it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in\n",
      "the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to\n",
      "scatter gloom and mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed\n",
      "its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible\n",
      "save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been\n",
      "difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it\n",
      "from the darkness by which it was surrounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside\n",
      "him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a\n",
      "solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither\n",
      "spoke nor moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To\n",
      "Come?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are about to show me shadows of the things that\n",
      "have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,\"\n",
      "Scrooge pursued. \"Is that so, Spirit?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an\n",
      "instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.\n",
      "That was the only answer he received.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although well used to ghostly company by this time,\n",
      "Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled\n",
      "beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when\n",
      "he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as\n",
      "observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him\n",
      "with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the\n",
      "dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon\n",
      "him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost,\n",
      "could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap\n",
      "of black.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ghost of the Future!\" he exclaimed, \"I fear you more\n",
      "than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose\n",
      "is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another\n",
      "man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company,\n",
      "and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak\n",
      "to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight\n",
      "before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is\n",
      "waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead\n",
      "on, Spirit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.\n",
      "Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him\n",
      "up, he thought, and carried him along.\n",
      "\n",
      "They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather\n",
      "seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its\n",
      "own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on\n",
      "'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down,\n",
      "and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\n",
      "groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully\n",
      "with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had\n",
      "seen them often.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.\n",
      "Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge\n",
      "advanced to listen to their talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I\n",
      "don't know much about it, either way. I only know he's\n",
      "dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When did he die?\" inquired another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Last night, I believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what was the matter with him?\" asked a third,\n",
      "taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box.\n",
      "\"I thought he'd never die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God knows,\" said the first, with a yawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has he done with his money?\" asked a red-faced\n",
      "gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his\n",
      "nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't heard,\" said the man with the large chin,\n",
      "yawning again. \"Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't\n",
      "left it to me. That's all I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,\" said the same\n",
      "speaker; \"for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go\n",
      "to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,\" observed the\n",
      "gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. \"But I must\n",
      "be fed, if I make one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\"\n",
      "said the first speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I\n",
      "never eat lunch. But I'll offer to go, if anybody else will.\n",
      "When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't\n",
      "his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak\n",
      "whenever we met. Bye, bye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with\n",
      "other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the\n",
      "Spirit for an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed\n",
      "to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking\n",
      "that the explanation might lie here.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business:\n",
      "very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point\n",
      "always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point\n",
      "of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you?\" said one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you?\" returned the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at\n",
      "last, hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I am told,\" returned the second. \"Cold, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seasonable for Christmas time. You're not a skater, I\n",
      "suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not another word. That was their meeting, their\n",
      "conversation, and their parting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the\n",
      "Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so\n",
      "trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden\n",
      "purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.\n",
      "They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the\n",
      "death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this\n",
      "Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of any\n",
      "one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could\n",
      "apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they\n",
      "applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement,\n",
      "he resolved to treasure up every word he heard,\n",
      "and everything he saw; and especially to observe the\n",
      "shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation\n",
      "that the conduct of his future self would give him\n",
      "the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these\n",
      "riddles easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked about in that very place for his own image; but\n",
      "another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the\n",
      "clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he\n",
      "saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured\n",
      "in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however;\n",
      "for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and\n",
      "thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried\n",
      "out in this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its\n",
      "outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his\n",
      "thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and\n",
      "its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes\n",
      "were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel\n",
      "very cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part\n",
      "of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before,\n",
      "although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The\n",
      "ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;\n",
      "the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and\n",
      "archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\n",
      "smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the\n",
      "whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed,\n",
      "beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags,\n",
      "bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor\n",
      "within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges,\n",
      "files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets\n",
      "that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in\n",
      "mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\n",
      "sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\n",
      "charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal,\n",
      "nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the\n",
      "cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous\n",
      "tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury\n",
      "of calm retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this\n",
      "man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the\n",
      "shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,\n",
      "similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by\n",
      "a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight\n",
      "of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each\n",
      "other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which\n",
      "the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three\n",
      "burst into a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\" cried she who\n",
      "had entered first. \"Let the laundress alone to be the second;\n",
      "and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look\n",
      "here, old Joe, here's a chance! If we haven't all three met\n",
      "here without meaning it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You couldn't have met in a better place,\" said old Joe,\n",
      "removing his pipe from his mouth. \"Come into the parlour.\n",
      "You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other\n",
      "two an't strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop.\n",
      "Ah! How it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of metal\n",
      "in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's\n",
      "no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We're all suitable\n",
      "to our calling, we're well matched. Come into the\n",
      "parlour. Come into the parlour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The\n",
      "old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and\n",
      "having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the\n",
      "stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he did this, the woman who had already spoken\n",
      "threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting\n",
      "manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and\n",
      "looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?\" said the\n",
      "woman. \"Every person has a right to take care of themselves.\n",
      "He always did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true, indeed!\" said the laundress. \"No man\n",
      "more so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid,\n",
      "woman; who's the wiser? We're not going to pick holes in\n",
      "each other's coats, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed!\" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.\n",
      "\"We should hope not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, then!\" cried the woman. \"That's enough.\n",
      "Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these?\n",
      "Not a dead man, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old\n",
      "screw,\" pursued the woman, \"why wasn't he natural in his\n",
      "lifetime? If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look\n",
      "after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying\n",
      "gasping out his last there, alone by himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the truest word that ever was spoke,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Dilber. \"It's a judgment on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\" replied the\n",
      "woman; \"and it should have been, you may depend upon it,\n",
      "if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that\n",
      "bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out\n",
      "plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to\n",
      "see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves,\n",
      "before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle,\n",
      "Joe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;\n",
      "and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first,\n",
      "produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two,\n",
      "a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no\n",
      "great value, were all. They were severally examined and\n",
      "appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed\n",
      "to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a\n",
      "total when he found there was nothing more to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's your account,\" said Joe, \"and I wouldn't give\n",
      "another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it.\n",
      "Who's next?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing\n",
      "apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of\n",
      "sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall\n",
      "in the same manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine,\n",
      "and that's the way I ruin myself,\" said old Joe. \"That's\n",
      "your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made\n",
      "it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and knock\n",
      "off half-a-crown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now undo my bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience\n",
      "of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,\n",
      "dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward\n",
      "on her crossed arms. \"Bed-curtains!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and\n",
      "all, with him lying there?\" said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes I do,\" replied the woman. \"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and\n",
      "you'll certainly do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything\n",
      "in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He\n",
      "was, I promise you, Joe,\" returned the woman coolly. \"Don't\n",
      "drop that oil upon the blankets, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His blankets?\" asked Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose else's do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He\n",
      "isn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?\" said\n",
      "old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I\n",
      "an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for\n",
      "such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that\n",
      "shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor\n",
      "a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine one too.\n",
      "They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied\n",
      "the woman with a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to\n",
      "do it, but I took it off again. If calico an't good enough for\n",
      "such a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything. It's quite\n",
      "as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than he did\n",
      "in that one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat\n",
      "grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by\n",
      "the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and\n",
      "disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they\n",
      "had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman, when old Joe,\n",
      "producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their\n",
      "several gains upon the ground. \"This is the end of it, you\n",
      "see! He frightened every one away from him when he was\n",
      "alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. \"I\n",
      "see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own.\n",
      "My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is\n",
      "this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now\n",
      "he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which,\n",
      "beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up,\n",
      "which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful\n",
      "language.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with\n",
      "any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience\n",
      "to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it\n",
      "was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon\n",
      "the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept,\n",
      "uncared for, was the body of this man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand\n",
      "was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted\n",
      "that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon\n",
      "Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought\n",
      "of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;\n",
      "but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss\n",
      "the spectre at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar\n",
      "here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy\n",
      "command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved,\n",
      "revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair\n",
      "to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\n",
      "not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;\n",
      "it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the\n",
      "hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,\n",
      "and tender; and the pulse a man's. Strike, Shadow, strike!\n",
      "And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow\n",
      "the world with life immortal!\n",
      "\n",
      "No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and\n",
      "yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He\n",
      "thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be\n",
      "his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?\n",
      "They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a\n",
      "woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this\n",
      "or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be\n",
      "kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was\n",
      "a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What\n",
      "they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so\n",
      "restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it,\n",
      "I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do\n",
      "it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have\n",
      "not the power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again it seemed to look upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion\n",

      "\n",
      "The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a\n",
      "moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room\n",
      "by daylight, where a mother and her children were.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;\n",
      "for she walked up and down the room; started at every\n",
      "sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;\n",
      "tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly\n",
      "bear the voices of the children in their play.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried\n",
      "to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was\n",
      "careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was\n",
      "a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight\n",
      "of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for\n",
      "him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news\n",
      "(which was not until after a long silence), he appeared\n",
      "embarrassed how to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it good?\" she said, \"or bad?\"--to help him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bad,\" he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are quite ruined?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. There is hope yet, Caroline.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he relents,\" she said, amazed, \"there is! Nothing is\n",
      "past hope, if such a miracle has happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is past relenting,\" said her husband. \"He is dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke\n",
      "truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she\n",
      "said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next\n",
      "moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of\n",
      "her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last\n",
      "night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a\n",
      "week's delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid\n",
      "me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only\n",
      "very ill, but dying, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To whom will our debt be transferred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know. But before that time we shall be ready\n",
      "with the money; and even though we were not, it would be\n",

      "successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.\n",
      "The children's faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what\n",
      "they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier\n",
      "house for this man's death! The only emotion that the\n",
      "Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of\n",
      "pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar\n",
      "to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and\n",
      "there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They\n",
      "entered poor Bob Cratchit's house; the dwelling he had\n",
      "visited before; and found the mother and the children seated\n",
      "round the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as\n",
      "still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter,\n",
      "who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters\n",
      "were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of\n",
      "them.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not\n",
      "dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he\n",
      "and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not\n",
      "go on?\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her\n",
      "hand up to her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The colour hurts my eyes,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're better now again,\" said Cratchit's wife. \"It\n",
      "makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak\n",
      "eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It\n",
      "must be near his time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book.\n",
      "\"But I think he has walked a little slower than he used,\n",
      "these few last evenings, mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a\n",
      "steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk\n",
      "with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so have I,\" cried Peter. \"Often.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so have I,\" exclaimed another. So had all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But he was very light to carry,\" she resumed, intent upon\n",
      "her work, \"and his father loved him so, that it was no\n",
      "trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter\n",
      "--he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea\n",
      "was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should\n",
      "help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got\n",
      "upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against\n",
      "his face, as if they said, \"Don't mind it, father. Don't be\n",
      "grieved!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to\n",
      "all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and\n",
      "praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls.\n",
      "They would be done long before Sunday, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his\n",
      "wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear,\" returned Bob. \"I wish you could have\n",
      "gone. It would have done you good to see how green a\n",
      "place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I\n",
      "would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!\"\n",
      "cried Bob. \"My little child!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he\n",
      "could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther\n",
      "apart perhaps than they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above,\n",
      "which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.\n",
      "There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were\n",
      "signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat\n",
      "down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed\n",
      "himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\n",
      "had happened, and went down again quite happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother\n",
      "working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness\n",
      "of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but\n",
      "once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing\n",
      "that he looked a little--\"just a little down you know,\" said\n",
      "Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. \"On\n",
      "which,\" said Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman\n",
      "you ever heard, I told him. 'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr.\n",
      "Cratchit,' he said, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife.'\n",
      "By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don't know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knew what, my dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that you were a good wife,\" replied Bob.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everybody knows that!\" said Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well observed, my boy!\" cried Bob. \"I hope they\n",
      "do. 'Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. If I\n",
      "can be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me\n",
      "his card, 'that's where I live. Pray come to me.' Now, it\n",
      "wasn't,\" cried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might be\n",
      "able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was\n",
      "quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our\n",
      "Tiny Tim, and felt with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure he's a good soul!\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would be surer of it, my dear,\" returned Bob, \"if\n",
      "you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--\n",
      "mark what I say!--if he got Peter a better situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only hear that, Peter,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then,\" cried one of the girls, \"Peter will be keeping\n",
      "company with some one, and setting up for himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get along with you!\" retorted Peter, grinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's just as likely as not,\" said Bob, \"one of these days;\n",
      "though there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But however\n",
      "and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we\n",
      "shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this\n",
      "first parting that there was among us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, father!\" cried they all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I know,\" said Bob, \"I know, my dears, that when\n",
      "we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he\n",
      "was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among\n",
      "ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, never, father!\" they all cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very happy,\" said little Bob, \"I am very happy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the\n",
      "two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook\n",
      "hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from\n",
      "God!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spectre,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our\n",
      "parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not\n",
      "how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as\n",
      "before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there\n",
      "seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were\n",
      "in the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed\n",
      "him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything,\n",
      "but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,\n",
      "until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now,\n",
      "is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length\n",
      "of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be,\n",
      "in days to come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The house is yonder,\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"Why do you\n",
      "point away?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The inexorable finger underwent no change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked\n",
      "in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was\n",
      "not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.\n",
      "The Phantom pointed as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither\n",
      "he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.\n",
      "He paused to look round before entering.\n",
      "\n",
      "A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name\n",
      "he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a\n",
      "worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and\n",
      "weeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up\n",
      "with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A\n",
      "worthy place!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to\n",
      "One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was\n",
      "exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new\n",
      "meaning in its solemn shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\"\n",
      "said Scrooge, \"answer me one question. Are these the\n",
      "shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of\n",
      "things that May be, only?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which\n",
      "it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if\n",
      "persevered in, they must lead,\" said Scrooge. \"But if the\n",
      "courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is\n",
      "thus with what you show me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit was immovable as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and\n",
      "following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected\n",
      "grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I that man who lay upon the bed?\" he cried, upon\n",
      "his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger still was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, \"hear me!\n",
      "I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must\n",
      "have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I\n",
      "am past all hope!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time the hand appeared to shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Spirit,\" he pursued, as down upon the ground he\n",
      "fell before it: \"Your nature intercedes for me, and pities\n",
      "me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you\n",
      "have shown me, by an altered life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind hand trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it\n",
      "all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the\n",
      "Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I\n",
      "will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I\n",
      "may sponge away the writing on this stone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to\n",
      "free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.\n",
      "The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate\n",
      "reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress.\n",
      "It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.\n",
      "\n",
      "YES! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own,\n",
      "the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time\n",
      "before him was his own, to make amends in!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!\"\n",
      "Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. \"The Spirits\n",

      "it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions,\n",
      "that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"They are not torn down,\" cried Scrooge, folding one of\n",

      "\"I don't know what to do!\" cried Scrooge, laughing and\n",

      "himself with his stockings. \"I am as light as a feather, I\n",
      "am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I\n",

      "\n",
      "Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so\n",

      "\"To-day!\" replied the boy. \"Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's Christmas Day!\" said Scrooge to himself. \"I\n",
      "haven't missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night.\n",
      "They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of\n",
      "course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallo!\" returned the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one,\n",
      "at the corner?\" Scrooge inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should hope I did,\" replied the lad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An intelligent boy!\" said Scrooge. \"A remarkable boy!\n",
      "Do you know whether they've sold the prize Turkey that\n",
      "was hanging up there?--Not the little prize Turkey: the\n",
      "big one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, the one as big as me?\" returned the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a delightful boy!\" said Scrooge. \"It's a pleasure\n",
      "to talk to him. Yes, my buck!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's hanging there now,\" replied the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it?\" said Scrooge. \"Go and buy it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Walk-ER!\" exclaimed the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Scrooge, \"I am in earnest. Go and buy\n",
      "it, and tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the\n",
      "direction where to take it. Come back with the man, and\n",
      "I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than\n",
      "five minutes and I'll give you half-a-crown!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady\n",
      "hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's!\" whispered Scrooge,\n",
      "rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. \"He sha'n't\n",
      "know who sends it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe\n",
      "Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's\n",
      "will be!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady\n",
      "one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to\n",
      "open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's\n",
      "man. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker\n",
      "caught his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall love it, as long as I live!\" cried Scrooge, patting\n",
      "it with his hand. \"I scarcely ever looked at it before.\n",
      "What an honest expression it has in its face! It's a\n",
      "wonderful knocker!--Here's the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop!\n",
      "How are you! Merry Christmas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his\n",
      "legs, that bird. He would have snapped 'em short off in a\n",
      "minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\"\n",
      "said Scrooge. \"You must have a cab.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with\n",
      "which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which\n",
      "he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed\n",
      "the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle\n",
      "with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\n",
      "chuckled till he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to\n",
      "shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when\n",
      "you don't dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the\n",
      "end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of\n",
      "sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and at last got out\n",
      "into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth,\n",
      "as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present;\n",
      "and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded\n",
      "every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly\n",
      "pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows\n",
      "said, \"Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!\"\n",
      "And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe\n",
      "sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he\n",
      "beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his\n",
      "counting-house the day before, and said, \"Scrooge and Marley's, I\n",
      "believe?\"  It sent a pang across his heart to think how this\n",
      "old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he\n",
      "knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and\n",
      "taking the old gentleman by both his hands. \"How do you\n",
      "do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of\n",
      "you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Scrooge?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Scrooge. \"That is my name, and I fear it\n",
      "may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon.\n",
      "And will you have the goodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in\n",
      "his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord bless me!\" cried the gentleman, as if his breath\n",
      "were taken away. \"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please,\" said Scrooge. \"Not a farthing less. A\n",
      "great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you.\n",
      "Will you do me that favour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said the other, shaking hands with him.\n",
      "\"I don't know what to say to such munifi--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge. \"Come\n",
      "and see me. Will you come and see me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will!\" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he\n",
      "meant to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank'ee,\" said Scrooge. \"I am much obliged to you.\n",
      "I thank you fifty times. Bless you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to church, and walked about the streets, and\n",
      "watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children\n",
      "on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into\n",
      "the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found\n",
      "that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never\n",
      "dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so\n",
      "much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps\n",
      "towards his nephew's house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the\n",
      "courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and\n",
      "did it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the\n",
      "girl. Nice girl! Very.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is he, my love?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll\n",
      "show you up-stairs, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank'ee. He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand\n",
      "already on the dining-room lock. \"I'll go in here, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door.\n",
      "They were looking at the table (which was spread out in\n",
      "great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous\n",
      "on such points, and like to see that everything is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fred!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!\n",
      "Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting\n",
      "in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done\n",
      "it, on any account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why bless my soul!\" cried Fred, \"who's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner.\n",
      "Will you let me in, Fred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.\n",
      "He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier.\n",
      "His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he\n",
      "came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did\n",
      "every one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful\n",
      "games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was\n",
      "early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob\n",
      "Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his\n",
      "heart upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No\n",
      "Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen\n",
      "minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his\n",
      "door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter\n",
      "too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his\n",
      "pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as\n",
      "near as he could feign it. \"What do you mean by coming\n",
      "here at this time of day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Bob. \"I am behind my time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are?\" repeated Scrooge. \"Yes. I think you are.\n",
      "Step this way, sir, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's only once a year, sir,\" pleaded Bob, appearing from\n",
      "the Tank. \"It shall not be repeated. I was making rather\n",
      "merry yesterday, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge, \"I\n",
      "am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And\n",
      "therefore,\" he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving\n",
      "Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into\n",
      "the Tank again; \"and therefore I am about to raise your\n",
      "salary!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He\n",
      "had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it,\n",
      "holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help\n",
      "and a strait-waistcoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge, with an earnestness\n",
      "that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the\n",
      "back. \"A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I\n",
      "have given you, for many a year! I'll raise your salary, and\n",
      "endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss\n",
      "your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\n",
      "smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another\n",
      "coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and\n",
      "infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was\n",
      "a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a\n",
      "master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or\n",
      "any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old\n",
      "world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him,\n",
      "but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was\n",
      "wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this\n",
      "globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill\n",
      "of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these\n",
      "would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\n",
      "should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in\n",
      "less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was\n",
      "quite enough for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon\n",
      "the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was\n",
      "always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas\n",
      "well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that\n",

    "# Task-5: Removal of Stop Words And Creating Word Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is the time when we are separating stopwords from our list of tokens for both books. Here firstly we have found the stopwords for the English language. Then one by one, we examined all the tokens and if that token is not a stopword, we considered it for further processing and will store them in a new list, and the words left will be of no use and hence won’t include them in the new list. This way we have removed the stopwords from Token_T1 and Token_T2. Then we have again found the frequency distribution for the cleaned set of tokens and plotted the new word graphs. As we can see stopwords like ‘a’, ‘i’, ‘the’ are no more appear in the frequency distribution as well as in the word cloud. And thus the most frequent word for Book1 i.e. Alice’s adventures in Wonderland is ‘said’ and for Book2 i.e.  A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas is ‘scrooge’."

Then for each possible word size, we found the number of words with that size and then stored all the pair of word length and number of such length words and then converted it to the data frame, which we further plotted using the matplotlib library, and visualized the relationship between length and frequency for both cleaned token set of book T1 and T2."
